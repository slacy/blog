At this time, I'm compelled to say that Google launched video playback
on [video.google.com](http://video.google.com) today! I think its pretty
neat -- my favorite video is called ["Why I Love Shoplifting from Big
Corporations"](http://video.google.com/videopreviewbig?q=shoplifting&time=0&page=1&docid=5357056239817178301&urlcreated=1119934717&chan=Uploaded&prog=Why+I+Love+Shoplifting+From+Big+Corporations&date=Sat+May+14+2005+at+4%3A11+AM+PDT).

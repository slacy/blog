Hello! Well, if you're reading this, then you look at my blog, and you
might notice that its looking a bit different today. I've migrated the
whole thing from pLog to WordPress 1.5. For those of you wondering why,
here goes:

- WordPress in freaking beautiful. I mean really, check out how good
this thing looks. The administration interface is as nice, possibly
nicer.  
- Automatic support for blogrolls  
- Builtin support for "links" and "pages" that are easy to author.  
- Support (WordPress is very well supported by the community, and seems
to be a much more well maintained project than pLog)  
- Trackbacks interface placed right in post creation  
- Cool "Press It" bookmarklet that will automatically redirect to login
with the right trackback.  
- Wonderful selection of themes

The list just goes on and on! Now, I'll need to spend some time making a
really nice WordPress theme (or maybe just downloading one).

If you want to be a "good RSS citizen" then you should update your RSS
browser to point at the new RSS feed location thats specified on this
page. I haven't added redirectors for Atom or other syndication formats,
so hopefully I'm not abandoning anyone.

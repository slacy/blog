I've always wondered:

SourceForge has a 2-letter domain at [sf.net](http://sf.net) but they
always just redirect immediately to sourceforge.net. This is the sort of
thing you'd do if you thought that you were at risk of losing the
domain, but they've been doing it like this for years. I wonder what
their reasoning is?

I like sf.net!

Today, 3 messages got past my virus filter! They were classified as SPAM
by my spam filter (they matched Pyzor, Razor, and DCC) because the text
of the message was the same as it usually is, but the virus binary
itself is different. Its been classified by clamav as Worm.MyTob.CJ

The reason that I missed it was that it was classified by clamav after I
had updated my virus signatures. Tonight, when the nightly update
happens, I'll get a new signature file, and this guy will be caught in
the future.

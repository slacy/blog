Some casual listening led me to find a band I have a few tracks of,
called "Sleepy Town Manufacture" that I got from the label
[monotonik](http://www.monotonik.com/), which I got from
[legaltorrents.com](http://legaltorrents.com/). Anyway, to make a long
story shorter, Sleepy Town Manufacture has a website, with a bunch of
ambient-esque music, and they link over to a Lithuanian label (zine?)
that has put out a few compilations with their stuff on it. So, check
out [stown.org](http://stown.org/), and the "e-magazine" (Seems like a
label to me) [Sutemos](http://sutemos.net/).  
I forgot to mention. The wget script is

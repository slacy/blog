[Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/) had a casual post about the
music on [ytcracker.com](http://www.ytcracker.com/) that sort of had the
feel of "is it good? is it bad? I can't tell". Well, after creating
[ytcraker.wget](http://slacy.com/music/ytcracker.wget) and downloading
about 700 Mb of music, I stumbled on his "Crazy 80's" album. Its really
fricking cool! I mean, like really really cool! Imagine all your 80's
music fav's (Police, U2, Information Society, etc.) mixed into a
techno-esque continual beat. Its all been sped up, and has a frenetic
feel to it that I really like. So, take look at
[this](http://www.ytcracker.com/music/demos/Crazy%2080s/), stat with
maybe track 002 or 003. (note: numbering starts with track 000, the
geeky way) Check it out, and let me know what **you** think.

What about the rest of the stuff there? Mostly, its white-boy
nerd-gangsta rap that frankly, I could mostly pass on. Some of it is
sort of fun, and some of it is sort of funny, but the production quality
is too low to make it really interesting.

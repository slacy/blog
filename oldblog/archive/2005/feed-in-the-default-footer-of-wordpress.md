Title: feed: in the default footer of WordPress

Okay, so WordPress is up and running, and I noticed that the default
theme has the link for RSS at the bottom with a URI that says
"feed://..."

I just want to point out how completely wrong this is. The first part of
a URI is the protocol, and in this case, one actually uses HTTP to fetch
RSS feeds, and even though the content is this ill-defined thing called
a "feed" that doesn't mean that the URI should start with "feed:". No
browser I know of handles "feed:" correctly, and in fact, to get the
behavior I think they were intending, they should just add a mime-type
handler for things of type "RSS." Looking at the RSS XML, generated by
WordPress, it actually doesn't have a proper XML header (like it should)
with a correct MIME type (like it should) so maybe they're just
misunderstanding the whole mess. Oh well, I would have thought they knew
better.

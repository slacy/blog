For my off-distro needs (xmms-mp3, mplayer, etc.) I always had a hard
time deciding between [dag](http://dag.wieers.com),
[livna](http://rpm.livna.org) and [freshrpms](http://freshrpms.net/).

Unfortunately, configuring a single machine to pull from all 3 of the
above repositories is basically impossible (since they export slightly
different builds of the same versions of a bunch of packages, like
mplayer).

Today, I've switched from Livna to Freshrpms for 3 reasons:

1\. Firefox 1.5 for x86\_64 is in freshrpms and not livna.  
2. ???  
3. profit!

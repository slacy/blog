I think I may have said this before, but: WHAT IS IT ABOUT OPEN SOURCE
PROJECTS THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM TELLING YOU WHAT THE FUCK THEY ACTUALLY
ARE!!!

Case in point, this recent [slashdot](http://slashdot.org) post. I
quoteth thus:  
<quote>  
After several months of frantic work by the evergrowing developer
community, the aptly numbered Inkscape 0.42 is out. The amount of new
features in this version is astounding. Quoting from the (gigantic!)
Release Notes, "while some of the new features simply fill long-standing
functionality gaps, others are truly revolutionary". Check out the
screenshots and grab your package for Linux, Windows, or OSX." The
screenshots are pretty mind-blowing; this isn't a 1.0 release, but I
think you'll agree it's worth checking out.  
</quote>

Are you just teasing me here? Are you trying to be exclusivist? Should I
know what Inkscape is? Now, I'll give this project a break, because he
does say on the [homepage](http://inkscape.org) exactly what Inkscape
is: "Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor". Thank you.

Big Example 2: Bittorrent. Imagine you don't know what bittorrent is,
and your friend told you to learn about it. You go to
[bittorrent.org](http://bittorrent.org) and see no useful information on
the home page. Okay, a link to download it, but you're not going to
download it until you know what it is. Oh look, and
"[introduction](http://www.bittorrent.com/introduction.html)" link.
First sentence?

<quote>What is BitTorrent?

BitTorrent is a free speech tool.  
</quote>

Hmm, so maybe its a text editor? A web publishing tool? There's a
diagram on the right that shows computers with lines inbetween them.
I've seen that diagram a thousand times, and it usually refers to a
small business LAN. Just read that introduction page and you'll see --
It doesn't say anything about what Bittorrent does **for the user**.
What *function* does it provide? Any one of the following would suffice:

<li>
Bittorrent is a file sharing protocol

</li>
<li>
Bittorrent allows you to quickly download large files

</li>
I'll end this discussion with a good example: The homepage of
[blender](http://blender.org) says:

<quote>  
Blender is the open source software for 3D modeling, animation,
rendering, post-production, interactive creation and playback (see the
features and screenshots). Available for all major operating systems
under the GNU Public License. </quote>

Thank god someone knows how to write.

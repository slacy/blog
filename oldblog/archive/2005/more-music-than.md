Yes, I admit it. I have somewhat of a compulsive addiction to finding
and downloading music off the internet. So, yesterday, I hit the mother
load. We're talking \*huge\*. All I should have to say is
[epitonic.com.](http://epitonic.com/). But, there's more. There's wget,
and there's a list of every file on their servers. 20 hours later, I'm
about half way through, and I've got just over 5 Gigs of new songs.
Listening to all this is going to be a bitch.

You can find all the information [here](http://slacy.com/music).

By the way, epitonic.com is all about "real" independent label music.
There's all kinds of cool stuff there, and probably a lot of bands
you've actually already heard of. Check it out, download free, legal
music.

I was looking at my web stats page today, and I noticed that I got
crawled by two new crawlers. Here's the deal:

[The Kototoi Project](http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/kototoi/)
appears to be a research project that is essentially doing what
AskJeeves is/was doing. I think this is a really good idea, but I never
thought that AskJeeves was that well implemented of a system. I once
asked it: "How many quarts of oil fit inside a 1971 volkswagen beetle"
It couldn't even come close to answering that question, but I know the
information is out there on the web. The problem is that so many of
those words are commonplace, and only form an interesting question when
used together. AskJeeves was showing me all sorts of information about
beetles (the insect kind) and modern volkswagens, and other oil-related
products that were totally unrelated. I haven't tried it since, so maybe
its gotten better.

The other project was [Grub.org](http://grub.org/).

It looks sort of interesting: An open-source distributed web crawler.
Now thats a cool piece of technology. I'm almost tempted to run it,
except that I'm sure my results would go into a research-ey vacuum. On
the other hand, if I believe its a good idea, then I should contribute
my bandwidth to the project, and make for a better world. Touch choice.

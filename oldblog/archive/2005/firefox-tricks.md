Okay, I just discovered some cool tricks for Mozilla Firefox. I'm sure
these are documented somewhere, but who reads documentation?

We all use the scroll wheel on our scroll mice, but wouldn't it be great
if you could do other navigations easily? Well, you can.

If you press SHIFT while scrolling, then it will go forward & back.
(Forward = "up" and Back = "down")  
If you press CTRL while scrolling, then it changes the font sizes
onscreen. (Larger = "down" and Smaller = "up")  
If you press ALT while scrolling, then it only scrolls by one line at a
time, instead of the deault. (not sure how to control this, but there
seems to be a setting in about:config, under
mouswheel.withnokey.numlines. I've changed that value, and seen very
little difference, so your mileage may vary)

[MetaFilter](http://metafilter.com/) posed this question: Is the
Kleptones "[A Night at the
Hip-Hopera](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/The%20Kleptones%20-%20A%20Night%20At%20The%20Hip-Hopera.torrent)"
better than DJ Danger Mouse's "[Grey
Album](http://www.bannedmusic.org/albums/download_grey.php)"?

Well, I'm happy to say that yes, it is much much much much better. I was
very underwhelmed by the Grey Album. It was interesting, but just a
mish-mash that I didn't really find that appealing. The Kleptones on the
other hand have made something really special. Lots of pop-culture
references (The Mooninites!), and a really cool mix of HipHop, Eminem,
and Queen, of all things. Check it out, while you still can.

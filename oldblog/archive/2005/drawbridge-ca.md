We went hiking to Drawbridge, CA yesterday. What's Drawbridge? Its a
ghost town out in the middle of the San Francisco bay, north of Alviso.
You can see it on [Google Maps
here](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=alviso,+ca&ll=37.466190,-121.974260&spn=0.004959,0.007950&t=k&hl=en)
(Look for the small grey rectangles by the train tracks.) All you have
to do to get there is go to the [Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National
Wildlife Refuge](http://www.fws.gov/pacific/desfbay/) and follow the
path that parallels the railroad tracks. When you see a chance to cross
over and walk on the tracks, take it, and continue heading north until
you cross the bridge, and then you're in Drawbridge!

Update: While we were there, we saw some white vans driving out. It
looks like there was an official excursion the very same day! But, those
guys didn't get to actually cross into drawdribge... [Here's the

A ghost town in San Francisco Bay? That’s right! Nestled on an island in
the salt marshes of south San Francisco Bay, the town of Drawbridge once
boomed. Was it a quiet, peaceful town full of nature lovers, or a
rip-roaring town full of two-fisted rowdies? Find out at this program,
led by Pat Anthony our Drawbridge expert. A slide show is followed by a
short mini-van excursion to view Drawbridge across Coyote Creek. Program
intended for adults. Space is very limited. RESERVATIONS ARE ESSENTIAL.

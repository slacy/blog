Okay, is it just me, or are there absolutely NO good TV shows on
anymore?

Seems like pretty much everything is going into reruns -- Lost, House,
Mythbusters, ATHF, The Office (did they cancel it?) Nothing new, nothing
good. Man, I hate the summer. :)

That said, I am sort of looking for something new and fun to watch. I
got a season pass to the HD version of Deadwood the other day, just to
see what its like. Not sure I want to commit, but it'll be interesting.
The other good thing is that we haven't seen all the most recent
episodes of House, so thats something to catch up on. Oh, and NUMB3RS
(gawd, I hate that name). I watched the first few minutes of an episode
once, and I kind of liked it. The whole "math can solve crimes" bent is
interesting, but the CSI-formula is tiring.

Just for a sanity check, I double checked with
[tvpicks.net](http://tvpicks.net), a blog I used to read, and it
confirmed my suspicions: TV sucks these days. I wonder how much of the
new fall lineup is going to be HD.

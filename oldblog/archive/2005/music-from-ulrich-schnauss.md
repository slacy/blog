I like to think of my music collection as my own radio station. Its like
a radio station in that sometimes I hear something that I really like
that I didn't even know I had. The other day it was a track by [Ulrich
Schnauss](http://ulrich-schnauss.com). That I had collected through the
[Intelligent Toys 2](http://www.sutemos.net/IT2/) compilation I got from
[legaltorrents.com](http://legaltorrents.com). So, now its boiled up,
and there are about 10 tracks on his website,
[ulrich-schnauss.com](http://ulrich-schnauss.com). You should download
them. They're good.

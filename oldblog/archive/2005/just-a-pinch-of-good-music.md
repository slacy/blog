Normally, when my mp3s are playing, and I hear something I really like,
I do a web search to find more about the band (there's lots of stuff in
my collection I've never listened to) Today, I heard a band called
Mellowdrone, and found [their website](http://mellowdrone.com/), and
downloaded a bunch of [their music](http://mellowdrone.com/music.html).
Its all good, maybe a bit too Coldplay/Radiohead-esque, but hey, what do
you expect for free!Â  They've got 13 songs there, so its a quick and
easy download session. Go for it!

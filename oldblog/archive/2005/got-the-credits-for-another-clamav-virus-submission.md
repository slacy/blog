Like I said, I've been submitting virus samples to
[clamav.net](http://clamav.net) over the last week or so. Well, the
samples that I submitted have been classified, and I got the credits on
one of them: Worm.Mytob.IG. I'm a little bit annoyed that I submitted
the samples days ago, and have only gotten a response today, when I got
nearly 10 copies of this virus. Thankfully,
[kaspersky](http://kaspersky.com) had already been classifying this, so
it means that spread probably isn't rampant, and most Windows desktop
scanners have probably found any copies that people have gotten via
e-mail.

ClamAV likes to boast about its response times, and I've seen times when
its very good, but the last few days have been troubling. I wonder how
many corporate mail servers use clamav as the scanner, and have been
letting through these virus mails, infecting corporate intranets and
letting the virus spread...

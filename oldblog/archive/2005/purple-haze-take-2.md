Okay, so you may or may not have seen these pages:

You should go take a look at them, and then continue reading this. So, I
saw them, and thought, "Hey, thats really cool, because it shows how the
country isn't as devided as we really think it is -- we're all just
purple". But then, I began to realize that my perception of purple is
really bad -- I can't tell a "reddish purple" from a "bluish purple" and
that might be actually skewing my impression of what this thing looks
like. So, I took the raw data from
[here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/maplinear1280x1024.png)
and I re-processed it so that Democratic counties go from pure blue to
pure white. Similarly, Republican counties go from pure red to white.
So, if a county is white, its exactly 50%/50%. If its slightly blue,
then its just "over the line" democratic, and similarly for republican.
Here's a small version of the re-processed map, and it links to the full
size one:

Coincidentally, I can produce this image:

Which shows how "divided" the country is, on a county by county basis.
Black counties are less divided, and white ones are more divided.

Unfortunately, to me, it looks a lot more red (and pink) than blue. Oh
well. Where were we headed anyway?

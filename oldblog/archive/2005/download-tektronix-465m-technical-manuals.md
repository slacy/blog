My Oscilloscope seems to have flaked out (I left it powered on all
night, and it wasn't working in the morning). So, I'm looking for
technical repair manuals for it, and there are lots of guys selling
them, but if you go to [this website](http://bama.sbc.edu/recent.htm),
you can find the manuals in downloadable form (albeit very slowly).

Update: I've put them on my website [here](http://slacy.com/tek) so that
you can get them at reasonable download rates.

Update2: I've found a mirror for the "Boat Anchor Manual Archive" thats
providing better transfer rates.Â  You can find that
[here](http://bama.edebris.com/manuals/).

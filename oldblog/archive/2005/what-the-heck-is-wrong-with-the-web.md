Click on [this

and let me know what happens.

For me, it shows the top of the page, then takes 30 seconds or so at
100% CPU usage before the page displays. And thats on my new computer,
an Athlon 64 4400+. Thats a crapload of CPU just to show a web page, and
I can't even fathom what the page is doing.

What the heck has happened to the web? Don't webmasters and designers
test their pages any more? Don't they realize that javascrpt is a
performance hog? What would posess someone to make a page like that?

Have you noticed that the word "terrorism" and "terrorist" have been
thrown around lately in the news media? Have you ever wondered who
actually fits that description? So, I set out to figure out what the
definition of terrorism actually was.

One of the best places to look is the government itself. What do *they*
think terrorism is? Well, looking at the [Code of Federal
Regulations](http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html) [Chapter 28,
Section
0.85](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?TITLE=28&PART=0&SECTION=85&YEAR=2003&TYPE=TEXT)
we can see that the Government defines terrorism:

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<span style="font-style: italic;">Terrorism includes the unlawful use of
force  
and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a  
government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in  
furtherance of political or social objectives.
</p>
<p>
</span>

</div>

Thats pretty good, and covers most of the bases.
[dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=terrorism) has
a couple good sources:

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<span margin="3em">American Heritage Dictionary: <span
style="font-style: italic;">The unlawful use or threatened use of force
or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property
with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments,
often for ideological or political reasons.</span></span>  
<span margin="3em"></span>  
<span margin="3em">
</p>
Merriam-Webster: <span style="font-style: italic;">The act of
terrorizing, or state of being terrorized; a mode of government by
terror or intimidation.</span></span>  
<span margin="3em"></span>  
<span margin="3em">

WordNet (Princeton): <span style="font-style: italic;">the calculated
use of violence (or threat of violence) against civilians in order to
attain goals that are political or religious or ideological in nature;
this is done through intimindation or coercion or instilling
fear.</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">

<p>
So, those are pretty good. Now, its time to ask the question:</span>

</div>

<b>Who is a terrorist?

</b>

Is it possible that the U.S. Government under George W. Bush is actually
a terrorist organization? Are we commiting acts of violence that are
political in nature? Are we using intimidation and coercion? What are
our objectives, and how are we obtaining them?

You can make your own decision.

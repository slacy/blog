Today's music download comes courtesy of Epitaph records. There's a
selection of about 550 different songs on the site, all 128kbps mp3
files. Bands include NOFX, Bad Religion, Offspring, Pennywise, Rancid,
etc. I think most of it is of the same vain (post-punk, rock, ska, etc.)
as those bands, but with a few oddballs thrown in the mix. Happy
downloading. You can find the wget file
[here.](http://slacy.com/music/epitaph.wget) Or, you can click through
the \~420 albums on the site to find the individual files. Whichever you
like. :)

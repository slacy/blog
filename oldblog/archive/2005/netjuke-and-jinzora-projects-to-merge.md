Oh man.

This is bad bad bad news. I tried Jinzora about a year ago, and it was a
huge mess. Totally unusable for collections more than a thousand or so
tracks, and this odd mentality of "precompute everything before the user
asks for it" just doesn't work when you've got 10,000+ tracks in your
collection.

I've been wishing that there was native MusicBrainz support in Netjuke,
as well as support for a lot of other interesting features. Maybe now is
the time to fork the Netjuke 1.x code base and start something
interesting. I can see lots of things that need to be done:

<li>
Adding support for songs in more than one "genre" or "group"

</li>
<li>
Adding support for "collections" of music

</li>
<li>
Fixing the "two artists with the same name" and "two albums with the
same name" problems

</li>
<li>
Fixing the interface with respect to recent artists & albums. (the
problem now is that if I have one track from an album, and then I
download the rest of the tracks, that it doesn't show up in the 'latest
albums' section

</li>
<li>
Better support for collections, soundtracks, various artists, etc.

</li>
Anyone interested?

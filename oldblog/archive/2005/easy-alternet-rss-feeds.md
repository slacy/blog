So, I found that [Annalee Newitz](http://techsploitation.com/)'s columns
are online at [AlterNet](http://alternet.org/), and I started looking
there for an RSS feed of just her posts. I looked everywhere on the site
and couldn't find one. So, I used the Feedback page to send a quick note
with that comment (they do have one RSS link to all columns on their
front page.). In a matter of minutes, I got an e-mail from the Directory
of Technology with a URL to a great list of feeds. Here it is: [AlterNet
RSS Feeds](http://www.alternet.org/webfeeds/)

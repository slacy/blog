Today, Creative announced the "[Zen
Vision:M](http://www.creative.com/products/mp3/zenvisionm/)" which is
basically an iPod Video clone. The interesting part is [this
photo](http://www.creative.com/products/mp3/zenvisionm/gallery/wpdownload.asp?f=/images/products/mp3/zenvisionm/wallpapers/wp1280_zenvisionm_1.jpg)
which clearly depicts a [Katamari](http://katamari.namco.com) made of
home entertainment products about to "Roll Up" a guy using the new Zen
Vision:M.

I wonder if its a copyright violation? What does this mean about the
popularity of [Katamari Damacy](http://katamaridamacy.jp)?

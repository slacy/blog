Have gotten 150 messages in the last 24 hours. Delivery is still very
spotty, with some hours averaging only 1 or 2 messages, others getting
over 50. I wonder if its individual machines getting infected, or some
other phenomenon thats clumping up message delivery.

If there's ever a worm/virus/trojan that can infect Linux-based servers,
routers, and network infrastructure boxes, we're all doomed. If that
ever happened I think the internet would be down for several days/weeks,
maybe longer. Imagine if your machine got so infected that you could not
access the network to grab virus removal software, software
patches/updates, or new signatures, never minding just browsing the web
for information about the virus. What would you do then? Reinstall the
software you already have that is guarantee to be almost immediately
re-infected? Shut down all network access?

What would the mass media (news agencies, etc.) think? How would this
impact the internet as a whole, peoples use of it as a "utility" and how
much of the working world would grind to a halt? Could you get your job
done at all?

For some strange reason, I already feel a strange bond with Feedster. I
know why, and its sort of a silly reason, but I can't/won't go into the
details here. Anyway, so, it looks like there are some other big(er)
contenders in the blogsearch space. Here are the two that I've just
tried getting indexed with:

[http://technorati.com](http://technorati.com/)  
[http://daypop.com](http://daypop.com/)  
[http://blogpulse.com](http://blogpulse.com/)

We'll see how that all goes. DayPop says I gotta check back in 2 weeks,
but technorati seems to imply that I'm crawled instantly. BlogPulse has
a really nice UI.Â  Check it out.

I'm not sure how I'll feel if/when Google gets into the blog space. I
think they'll do a fantastic job, but I'd like to think that they don't
have a monopoly on "internet information searches" which is why feedster
seems like such a great idea. Then again, feedster's UI is nothing more
than a simple ripoff of Google. Maybe they're looking to be bought or
something?

![](http://artcarfest.com/images/2004Logo.gif)I was listening to KFJC
(89.7) this evening on the way home from work, and they were talking
about the Art Car Fest going on this Saturday at the San Jose Museum of
Art (more generic name please?) Its all day, there will be over 100
cars, and seems cool. Check out

About a month ago, I got a call from a reporter with the [Palo Alto
Weekly](http://paloaltoonline.com) which is a sister publication of the
[Mountain View Voice](http://mv-voice.com). They wanted to chat about my
"recent" homebuying experience (we bought about a year ago). I told them
the whole story, and it turned out that they basically put the whole
thing in the paper word-for-word!. Here's a link to the scans. Make sure

**UPDATE:** This exact same article appears in the Palo Alto Weekly this
week as well.

[SlimDevices just announced their Squeezebox version 3 networked music
player.](http://slimdevices.com) I'm not sure what my take on this is --
I've been contemplating adding one of these to my livingroom system, but
the new form factor makes that pretty difficult, since it won't really
fit right in my media cabinet. But, the other perspective is that it
makes a **much** better standalone player.

I still wish they offered a version that looked like a stereo component.

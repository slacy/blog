So, this morning, two messages containing Mytob.DD made it through my
filter, even though I'm updating my filter every 4 hours now. That means
that I'm recieving these messages within 4 hours of their detection by
clamav.net. I'm really surprised, and am going to update every 2 hours
from now on.

Also of note is that Mytob is at version DD -- thats over 130 variants
of Mytob out there...

After importing all our photos into Gallery2, access is a fair bit
faster, so I've been looking at some old pictures. I've also added some
random pics to this page, and on our gallery main page, which makes it
easier to dig into old stuff. [Here is a link to the old (1994)
pictures](http://slacy.com/gallery/v/1994/album115/), [and here is a
link to the new (2004)
pictures](http://slacy.com/gallery/v/2004/carnival04/album125/) Here are
some thumbnails:

I also took a few panoramas back then, and I've been meaning to get
around to stitching them together. 11 years later, and here ya go:

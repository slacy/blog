Well, poking around on ccmixter.org got me to
[WebJay](http://webjay.org) (although their site is painfully slow).
Then, while reading about the [XPSF](http://xspf.org) (an XML Playlist)
file, I got a link to [Plurn](http://plurn.com), which is essentially
the same as [WebJay](http://webjay.org), but its actually responding in
a reasonable fashion.

I'm quickly finding that the amount of music on the web greatly exceeds
my desire for new music. I think there needs to be a better system of
blog-reviewing publically (and non-publically) available content. I may
start working on a WordPress plugin that puts some unique meta tags that
can be searched for to find reviews of a given URL.

To start with, it may just be a simple "music review" WordPress plugin
that helps people write music reviews. From there, it would be fairly
easy to add some sort of tagging/meta support to unify content.

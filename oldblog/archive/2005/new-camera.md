After a round of **really** disappointing image quality from my old
digital camera, I decided that it was time to upgrade. I did a bit of
research, but decided to stick with basically what I had before, but
newer. So, I got a Canon SD550. It fits my "rule of 2" which says you
only upgrade your equipment when the new stuff is twice as good as the
old stuff. So, my old camera is 3.2 Megapixels, and the new one is 7.1,
so we're a bit beyond the rule. I also like the fact that the user
interface is essentially the same as the old camera, but with some of
the eccentricities of the old one fixed. Its a nice upgrade. Some pics
are forthcoming soon.

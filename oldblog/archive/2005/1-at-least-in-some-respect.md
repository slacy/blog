Following a [story about Google doubling the size of its Image
index](http://google.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000450054054/), I've found
that if you search images for
"[slacy](http://images.google.com/images?q=slacy&hl=en&btnG=Search+Images)",
our cat Elsa is the \#1 result. Yay! Go Elsa! By the way, thats her in
my [Kitty
Portraits](http://slacy.com/blog/index.php/2005/08/09/kitten-portraits/)
post as well.

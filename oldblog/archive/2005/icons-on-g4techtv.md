It seems like the hip cool thing to do these days is bash the merger
between G4 and TechTV (now called G4TechTV) and their new website
(g4techtv.com).

But, I'm not going to do that! Through the grace of the merger, I think
we have been given a fairly good new channel. They got rid of a lot of
the declining crap that TechTV had, and they added a few new pragograms,
one of which I really like.

The show is called "Icons." Each episode is a 30-minute mini-documentary
about an important game, gaming system, or personality from the gaming
industry. They've featured things like D&D, Tetris, Gameboy, Sonic, etc.
They're all very well produced, the interviews are intelligent and
informative, and they get straight to the point.

After watching a few, they do get a little repetitive: "In the early
80's, there were games, then they got better, then worse, and now better
again!" This is the general gist of almost every episode, but I'll have
to say that I like it.

Now, lets just hope they keep all the other good TechTV programming: Big
Thinkers, Body Hits & Invent This!, all of which are excellent shows.

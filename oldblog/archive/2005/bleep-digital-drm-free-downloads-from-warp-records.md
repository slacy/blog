Looks like Warp Records (which is the parent-label of many others,
including [One Little Indian](http://indian.co.uk/), which is
[Bjork](http://bjork.com/)'s label) has decided to start running their
own DRM-Free music download service! Good going, guys! I fully support
this kind of move. Its DRM-Free, which means I can play it anytime,
anywhere. They're high-quality mp3 files, and thats really good. I also
like the thought of putting my money as close to the artist as possible.
For example, when I buy a CD at Tower, some profits go to Tower, some to
the distributor, some to the label, and some to the artist. The
proportion is very small that actually makes it there. But, for example,
when I buy a CD at a concert, almost 100% of the money goes directly to
the artist. This has two big benefits. The first is that the CDs are
usually cheaper this way, and the second is that I'm more directly
supporting what I believe in.

The one down side of what warprecords is doing is the cost -- they're
currently charging \$1.35/song, which seems pretty steep to me. But, I
presume its exclusive stuff, which is really good, and they offer a
fairly nice preview system without even having to log in.

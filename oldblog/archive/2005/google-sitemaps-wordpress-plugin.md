Just thought I'd get on the bandwagon with Google Sitemaps, so I
downloaded the most popular [Google Sitemaps Generater for
WordPress](http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2005/06/05/google-sitemaps-generator-v2-final).
It was really easy to set up, and turn on.

I'm a little disappointed that it pre-generates the sitemap XML files
instead of just generating them directly from the MySQL database. That
seems sort of silly to me, but I guess it makes sense if you've got some
mostrous blog (but then again, you're probably not using WordPress if
you do). I'm not sure if this will change things (the number of hits I
get from Google searches) but we'll see...

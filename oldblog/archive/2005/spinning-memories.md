At work today, I decided to put on a mix of some old music from the
early 90's that I used to listen to a \*lot\*, and it evoked a really
interesting memory:

As the music was playing, I had the distinct memory of watching a CD
spin through the window of a portable compact disc player.

Its almost like one of those viceral smell-memories where you vividly
remember the time and place of a certain smell. And the funny part is,
it includes this weird feeling of the "bliss" of being a 16-year old
with a portable CD player. It was feeling cool, and special, and "high
fidelity" and everything great. I had my Radio Shack brand headphones
(with Neodymium magnets) and I felt like I was sooooo cool. I had a
special padded carrying case, mostly so that my CD player wouldn't skip.
Skipping music was a big problem back then. Forget walking and listening
to music at the same time, it just wasn't possible. Plus, I was so
scared of damaging my cherished portable CD player, I'd never do
anything that might possibly damage it.

Its sort of different now as I stream realtime transcoded MP3 files from
my Linux-based dual-core AMD 4400+ server with RAID-5 disk array over my
DSL line to my dual-21 inch monitors at work. But, the feeling is still
there, its high tech, but for me, its taken on more of a pratical
reality than luxurious decadance.

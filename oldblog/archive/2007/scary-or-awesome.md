A friend recently got a job at [Kai Sensors](http://kaisensors.com).
They make a product called LifeReader. Here's their description of the
product:

> Kai Sensors will rapidly commercialize products based on its
> proprietary, state of the art, Heart Sensing Radar technology. This
> breakthrough, enabling, platform technology, which the company has
> named LifeReaderâ„¢, enables detection and monitoring of one or multiple
> subjects, even through barriers. It has the ability to accurately
> detect and monitor heart and respiration activity wirelessly,
> remotely, and with no contact to the subjects.

That sounds totally awesome, and totally scary at the exact same time.
My first reaction is that this is the first step towards the Star Trek
style "TriCorder", and then my second reaction is sheer terror over the
thought of this technology being installed in places like Airports to
try to 'weed out' possible terrorists.

Its as if there's a need for new legislation like the one that makes
business put up signs that say "This area under Closed Circuit
Surveillance" but with some other message that says "we're spying on
your heartrate, breathing, and whatever else we can remotely sense".
Yowza.

BTW, if you're an EE and you want to move to Hawaii, they're hiring.
E-mail me and I can hook you up. :)

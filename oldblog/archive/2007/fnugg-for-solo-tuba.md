My last batch of EMusic downloads included a great album called "BIS
35th Anniversary: 2 Hours of Glorious Free Listening" which is a
surprisingly excellent classical compilation. Its such a wide-ranging
spectrum of classical music that it really makes me want to have more
"fun" classical music in my collection. (You can see the tracklist
[here](http://www.emusic.com/album/Various-Artists-BIS-35th-Anniversary-2-Hours-of-Glorious-Free-Lis-MP3-Download/11115243.html))
Its actually a free download from EMusic, so if you're a subscriber, go
grab this one ASAP.

The weird thing about this album is the first track, "Fnugg for solo
tuba". What? Fnugg? Yes, its solo tuba, and its probably best described
as sounding like [Tuvan throat
signing](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00080AA2-BA32-1C73-9B81809EC588EF21)
crossed with a didgeridoo. Now, this kind of thing isn't actually that
out of place in my music collection, but when its placed alongside the
Moonlight Sonata and the Four Seasons, then you know something more is
going on.

So, I dug a bit more, and found that this piece is a one-of-a-kind
composition by a Norwegian Tuba Soloist named [Oystein
Baadsvik](http://baadsvik.com), and it seems like he's the only person
who's ever performed it. And, strangely enough, he's uploaded himself to
YouTube, so you can watch him play and explain the origins of Fnugg!

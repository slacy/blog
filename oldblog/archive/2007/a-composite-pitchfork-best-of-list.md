I saw that [Pitchfork](http://pitchforkmedia.com) released their
[staff's picks for the top 25 albums of the
year](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/47484-staff-list-2007-individual-albums-lists).
The problem is, I have no idea who these people are, and which ones are
interesting. So I sucked the whole thing in, and counted up which albums
were most referenced in the list. Here's the composite top-25 albums
from the staff's picks. The second number is the count of times that
album appeared in someone's top-25 list. Note: There were 36
contributing staff members.

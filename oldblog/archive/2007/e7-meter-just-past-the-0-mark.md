I was walking by our electricity meter the other day, and noticed that
it read "50,000 kWh" -- the same number that it read when it was
installed about six months ago! So, I took a photo! Since fall, we've
been producing a lot less electricity. Partly because of the baby (more
laundry, and generally more 'use' for the house) but the even bigger
impact is the shade thats hitting our panels and cutting out production
for most of the afternoon.

This is exactly what we expected -- the SolarCity installer originally
predicted that in the month of December, we'll only have 37% of our
possible production due to shading. Thankfully, we've built up &gt;\$300
credit with PG&E, and now we can start to use up that credit.

I still expect us to be nearly "net \$0" for the year, but its looking
less likely that we'll be "net 0kWh" for the year.

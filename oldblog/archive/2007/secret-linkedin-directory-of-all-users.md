Title: 'Secret' LinkedIn directory of all users!

While google searching around for someone who I thought was an
ex-coworker, I found a bunch of results from a [Hidden 'find' interface
on LinkedIn that has a directory of every single person in the whole
system](http://www.linkedin.com/find/a-z.html). It really looks to me
like they implemented this just for search engines. I'm a bit relieved
to see that there aren't that many details on the results page, just
general occupation and location, but I was disturbed that I'm in the
list, and its easy enough to click through to my entire profile.

Yes, this same information is available via the normal 'search'
interface on LinkedIn, but its a bit odd to see what amounts to the
entirety of LinkedIn user base on a set of static HTML pages.

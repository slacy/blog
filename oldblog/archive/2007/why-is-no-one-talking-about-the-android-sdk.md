[The Android SDK has been
released.](http://code.google.com/android/download.html) Why isn't
anyone talking about it?

Update: Looks like everyone just took a little while to start talking
about the [\$10M Android developer
challenge](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/calling-all-developers-10m-android.html)

I recently found out about
[CHDK](http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK#Download), which is an
alternate firmware build for Canon Digic II and Digic III cameras. It
offers some interesting features that aren't supported by the standard
firmware. Most notably, scripting, live histograms, and RAW support for
compact cameras. Looks pretty cool, but it doesn't support the SDXXX
cameras, like the one I've got, and I don't need to touch the firmware
on my XTi.

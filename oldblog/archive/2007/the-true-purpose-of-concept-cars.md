I just want to set the record straight here, since a couple concept cars
have been getting a lot of press lately.

The purpose of concept cars is to make you think that a car company is
developing "your perfect car" even though they're really not.

By doing so, they give you the impression that their company is the
"perfect company that meets your demands" but, in fact, they are not,
they still produce gas hogging behemoths, and they're never going to
bring to production that glorious concept car that you've been so lured
in by.

For example, the [Chevy Volt](http://chevy.com/volt) and the [Ford
Airstream
Concept](http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/01/08/ford-airstream-concept-a-shiny-hydrogen-powered-phev-funmobile/).
The ludicrocity of the situation is exemplified by the Ford vehicle,
which has the dizzying array of a drivetrain:

-   Hydrogen Fuel Cell
-   Battery Electric
-   Plug-In "Hybrid"

Thats like saying an airplane is a "Hyper Sonic Rocket Powered Bi-plane
Jet Prop Glider." Its utter nonsense. Oh, and did I mention that its
made of Stainless Steel? Big, Heavy, Shiny, Stainless Steel? Yes, Shiny!
You are mezmorized! It matches your refrigerator! You must buy. Ford is
infallible. Ford is awesome. Ford will save the environment with their
PHEV Hydrogen Powered Battery Electric SUV. Yes..... Yesssss!!!

What was I saying?

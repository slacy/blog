The annual [SXSW (South By Southwest)](http://2007.sxsw.com) music
festival is one of my main sources of finding new, excellent music.
Every year, the organizers of the show produce a torrent full of demo
songs from all the participants. Although it was hard to find, I just
found the 2007 torrent linked from [the toolbox
page](http://2007.sxsw.com/toolbox/). Here's a direct link to the [2007
sxsw torrent as
well](http://player.sxsw.com/torrents/SXSW_2007_Showcasing_Artists-Release_1.torrent).
Be careful, its 739 songs, 3.1GB!

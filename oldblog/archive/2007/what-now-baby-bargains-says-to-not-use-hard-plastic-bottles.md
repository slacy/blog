annoying.](http://baby411.typepad.com/babybargains/2007/08/consumer-alert-.html)
BabyBargains says we're not supposed to use any hard plastic bottles,
due to the chemical BPA. Unfortunately, our kid is using Avent bottles,
and he won't really take any other ones (but I'm sure he'll get used to
anything if we switch).

I had read a bunch about bisphenol A (BPA) before, and the verdict was
that it was only released from hard plastic bottles under extreme heat
(like what happens in an electrically heated dishwasher). We started out
hand washing the bottles, and then switched to using the dishwasher but
used the "energy saver" unheated drying cycle, which I also heard was
O.K. for hard plastic bottles.

Now, I'm not sure what to do.

Update: Its not all doom and gloom. [A government panel has said the
risk is
'minimal'](http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-08-08-bisphonolA_N.htm).
Who do you trust?

So, I got this comment on a random post to my blog that said:

> What about the possibility of pulling out of Iraq, letting Iran invade
> and lose resources fighting their own kind, and then come in and mop
> up the dregs?

And I thought: Okay, its just another spammer, probably with some
trackback spam (as usual) trolling their way through the internet. The
weird part was that there wasn't a bogus trackback URL, there wasn't
anything that made it look like spam. In fact, I'm not really sure where
it came from.

So, I googled for
[nemoforone](http://www.google.com/search?q=nemoforone) and all I got
were a bunch of profiles setup on online communities. Interesting. This
person did a good job choosing a unique name.

So, then I googled for [the complete phrase
above](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22What+about+the+possibility+of+pulling+out+of+Iraq%2C+letting+Iran+invade+and+lose+resources+fighting+their+own+kind%2C+and+then+come+in+and+mop+up+the+dregs%3F%22&btnG=Google+Search),
and found page after page of blog comments with the exact same text.
Some seem to have started an actual discussion, and others seem to have
been completely ignored.

Whats the deal with this guy? Is he trying to create a web meme around
his idea? What sort of botnet could he be using to post these comments?
I'm curious about it, the how's and why's, but its sort of hard to track
it down, so I thought I'd just point it out...

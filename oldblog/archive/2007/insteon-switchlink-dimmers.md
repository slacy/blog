Has anyone out there bought and installed any of the [Insteon
SwitchLink](http://www.smarthome.com/2476d_light_dimmer.html) dimmer
switches? I'm thinking of upgrading some of my switches which are poorly
positioned, and tying them all together into a single virtual N-way
system. The problem is that it says that the neutral connection is
"required" but I don't think that I have neutral at all my switch
locations. Some instructions somewhere said something like "simply run a
neutral wire to each switchbox" Uh, yeah. Right. And while I'm there why
don't I just rewire my whole house?

Do these things work? Do they really need a neutral wire all the time?

Well, I've finally found an easy way to use [last.fm](http://last.fm)
with the way I listen to music -- which is all from my personal server.

It turns out that [ampache](http://ampache.org) has a builtin last.fm
client support. So, anything that anyone plays using my ampache server
automatically gets "scrobbled" to last.fm. I've currently set it up so
all ampache users filter through the same last.fm user, but this can be
changed.

So, you can see [my user profile on
last.fm](http://last.fm/user/smlacy). To see what I'm listening to, and
my recommendations and stuff. Cool! Unfortunately, It took 5+ years
(since the inception of audioscrobbler and last.fm) for there to be a
workable solution to my flow. Thats kinda scary, but I'm happy that its
finally working. Ampache rocks!

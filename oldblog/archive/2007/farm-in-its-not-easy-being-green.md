We've been watching "[It's Not Easy Being
Green](http://www.itsnoteasybeinggreen.org/)" on BBC America, and
although they didn't say exactly where the New House Farm house is, it
was pretty easy to find it based on the areal map that they showed in
the first episode.  Its in Tywardreath, England.  [Here's an exact
pointer to the
farm.  ](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=111396451847773807791.000436b0ebca52912b384&ll=50.35666,-4.693565&spn=0.009761,0.019934&t=h&z=16&om=1)

Unfortunately, you can't see any of the stuff they built, like the
waterwheel.  Oh well, maybe when Google updates the satellite imagery,
it'll show something new...

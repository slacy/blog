I read this interesting article from Wired about [Mileage
Runners](http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/07/mileage_runner?currentPage=1).
In brief, Mileage Runners are people who find really cheap airline
fares, with the sole intent of accumulating mileage points as cheaply as
possible. Then, they use these miles to get more expensive flights for
free. To me, it sounds like a colossal waste of time, but it was an
interesting peek into what people obsess over.

But, there's a nugget of gold in that article, and its the link to the
[ITA Software](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/cvg/dispatch/prego)
publicly accessible web interface. What I learned from the article is
that ITA Software writes the backends for the big airlines, and they
have a web interface where you can search for cheap flights. Its a bit
crude, but it seems to have some really powerful search options. For
example, the abiltiy to find the cheapest weekend flights over a 30 day
period. Pretty cool!

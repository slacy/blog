I think [Cognitive Daily](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily) might
be my most favorite blog that I've just discovered. I found this article
on [Kids' misconceptions about numbers -- and how they fix
them](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2007/12/one_of_our_readers_emailed.php)
to be really fascinating.

Well, after returning the Netgear SC101 piece of junk, I decided to pick
up my second choice, which was a "Venus T4U" USB 2.0 enclosure by [AMS
Electronics](http://amselectronics.com/). The cool part about this thing
is that it holds 4 drives, a power supply, and a simple USB chipset
thats smart enough to unify all the drives into one single volume.

So, for the price of the T4U, I've not got 4 old drives all joined
together into a single backup volume.

The advantage: It was about half the cost of getting a drive of that
capacity new.  
The disadvantage: I'm now reliant on the T4U for its JBOD capability --
if there's a hardware failure in the unit, I'm pretty much screwed. I'm
not too worried about this, since the T4U is my backup drive, and I
leave it powered off most of the time.

Someone at work pointed me at the [It's All
Text!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125) Firefox
plugin. All it does is put a small "edit" button at the bottom of every
text area. You can click the button and edit the text in an external
editor. Since we use a Wiki at work a lot, this is extremely useful!
Editing a huge wiki document in the browsers text area is just stupid.
Doing it in emacs rocks!

Well, I've finally become a convert. After using GMail for a while at
work, I've become addicted enough to want to use it on my personal
accounts. I looked into Google Apps For Your Domain, created an account,
but decided not to go that way. Here's how I saw things:

-   Good: It totally takes over your e-mail.
-   Bad: You have to change your MX record -- no way to keep a copy of
    the e-mails yourself.
-   Good: Its easy to use, and branded to "my domain" (like that
    really matters)
-   ???: Can I unify my old GMail account with my Google Apps account?
    How?

Anyway, since I was really intent on keeping a copy of all my e-mail on
my own server, I decided that I shouldn't use Google Apps, and that I
should just have postfix send an extra copy to my exsiting gmail
account. That way, I get to keep the originals, as well as have the nice
web interface that I've become addicted to. Its seeming to work out
really well so far, and I've set it up to set the "reply-to" as my old
account name, so unless people are really paying a lot of attention,
they shouldn't even be able to tell I'm using gmail.

Hooray!

(I'll post here if there are any other problems in the future...)

As you may (or may not have [heard](http://chocomonkey.com/blog/?p=19)),
we're in the process of choosing some new windows for our house. I
expect it to have a pretty radical change in the way it all looks, so I
took a couple pictures just to preserve the way things look, and to help
us think about what we want from the new ones...

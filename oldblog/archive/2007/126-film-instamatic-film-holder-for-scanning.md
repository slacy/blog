[Here are some good instructions on how to turn a 35mm film holder into
something that will hold 126 size
film](http://photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=006PUv). The
important part is the link to the supplier where you can buy extra 35mm
holders for your Epson scanners. I haven't done this yet, but its likely
that its what I'll do.

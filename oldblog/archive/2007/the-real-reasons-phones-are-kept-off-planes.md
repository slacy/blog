Following [this Slashdot
post](http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/08/1528217.shtml), I present
you my theory on the real reason phones are kept off planes:

People are obnoxious bastards, and no one wants to sit on a 12 hour long
plane flight full of 200 people's simultaneous incessant jabbering. Its
bad enough that there are the morons with DVD players and **no
headphones**! I don't want to listen to your movie, thanks!

Well, after spending 2 weeks in a hotel with our cats while our entire
house was painted, had baseboards replaced, added crown molding, and all
that jazz, we've finally moved back in again!

Its a great feeling to be back home, and gives me an odd feeling of the
combination of that feeling when you get when you've just come home from
vacation, and that feeling you get when you're moving in to a new house
and there's excitement and anticipation! I think some of the excitement
and anticipation most be coming from the reality that the baby is only
about 2 weeks away. We've still got a lot to do! Set up crib! Buy more
baby clothes! Buy diapers! A million other things!

Pics of the totally new house will be coming soon. They're just
finishing up on the exterior trim and details today, but the inside is
basically done, although all the furniture needs to be un-piled from the
center of most of the rooms. We got inspected by the city yesterday, and
that means we have fancy new smoke detectors everywhere, which is a nice
thing to have done right before the baby. This is also a good time to
replace all the outlets and switches so they all match, and to get rid
of the nasty beige ones that don't go with our new colors inside. We've
also got to find and install new towel bars and bathroom stuff, since
the old ones were pretty ugly... so much to do!

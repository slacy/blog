Title: We're a Squeezebox household now.

When we turned off the PC that we used to use for watching TV, it also
took away our ability to play music in the livingroom (since the HD TiVo
that we have doesn't support HME or HMO). So, we decided to break down
and buy a couple more [Squeezeboxes](http://slimdevices.com) for the
rest of the house. We got systems for the livingroom, upstairs, and the
nursery.

I was a bit hesitant about the new Squeezebox v3 form factor, but when
the units arrived, my opinion was totally changed. First, they're a lot
smaller than they look on the website. All the low-angle photography
makes them look a lot bigger than they are. Small is good.

Second, they have much nicer displays than the Squeezebox v2 that we
have in the kitchen. (We now have a total of 4). The display is larger
in size as well as larger in pixels. It also supports multiple levels of
brightness (per pixel) which means that the big fonts are nicely
antialiased. It also means that there's a cool mode that shows a dim
spectrogram underneath the normal "Now Playing" track info display. Its
really slick.

I'm going to be using the upstairs unit as an alarm clock, since the
server software can turn the units on at a specified time and play any
playlist. The cool thing about that is that because of the NPR podcasts,
I can wake up to CarTalk on Monday, This American Life on Tuesday, etc.
It'll be great!

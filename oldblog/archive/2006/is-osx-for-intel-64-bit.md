I've searched around the Apple site trying to figure out if OSX for
Intel is 64-bit or not, and since I can't find anything that says it
*is* then should I assume that it *isn't*?

**UPDATE:** I searched technorati, and it appears as though the "Core
Duo" processors currently aren't 64-bit. This seems like a step in the
wrong direction for Apple. I think by this time Apple desktop power
users expect 64-bit performance and memory sizes. I guess something now
is better than sacrificing their current sales. I still wonder how AMD
lost the deal with Apple. They must have been in the running...

We spent the last 2 weeks touring Japan: Tokyo, Nikko, Matsuyama & Dogo,
Miyajima, Hiroshima, & Kyoto. Had an awesome time, and are still sifting
through the \~1500 pictures we took. In the mean time, if you really
want, you can sift through them yourself. Any comments on good ones &
bad ones would be appreciated! :)

We should have a more whittled down gallery of just the "good ones" in a
day or 2.

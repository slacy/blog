I was driving on the highway today, and was looking at the other cars,
and parcitularly, their "badging". I saw things like "5.8", "V8",
"Turbo", "2.0T", "VR6" and even an occasional "Fuel Injection", "HSD",
"VTEC" or "VVTI". What I realized is that these are all ICE-specific
terms, and that its part of the giant marketing phenomenon that is the
major auto manufacturers. I also realized a couple things:

First, if your friend got a new car, and you asked what kind of engine,
and he said "Its got a 2.3" you'd actually know what he was talking
about. Similarly, for "Its got a V8".

Second, that there are an immense set of stats and numbers that the
average person understands around ICE parlance: Displacement in Liters
or Cubic Inches, Horsepower, Number of Cylinders, "Extras" like Turbo or
Supercharger, Torque in Foot Pounds, and last of all, Highway and City
Fuel Economy.

I think that [Tesla Motors](http://teslamotors) and even Toyota, should
begin to educate the public around the stats that are interesting for
Electric Vehicles.

Here are some things to think about:

Displacement \~= Voltage (say, 144V)  
Max Torque \~= Maximum Amperage (say, 1000A, depending on motor)  
Fuel Economy = Watt Hours / mile (Wh/m) for city & highway driving  
Gas Tank Size \~= Total battery pack size in Watt Hours (say, 15kWh for
a small car)

The other crazy thing is that the methods of measurement of Horsepower
and Torque for ICE engines vs. Electric motors is vastly different. You
can't just say that a 100hp gas motor is the same power as a 100hp
electric motor. Its generally accepted that the electric motor is rated
at about half of the equivalent number that a gas motor would have. So,
that means thta a 100hp electric motor is as "fast" as a 200hp gas
motor.

So, some day, your friend will get a new EV, and you'll say "what kind
of motor does it have?" and he'll say "Its got a 288V system that can
draw 2000A" and you'll know that he'll be smoking tires up to 40 mph.

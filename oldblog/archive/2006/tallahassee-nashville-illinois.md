What do these 2 cities and state have in common?

They're the names of 3 extremely excellent albums.

[Tallahassee by the Mountain
Goats](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006YXH6/sr=8-1/qid=1141199183/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8898263-5177552?%5Fencoding=UTF8)

[Nashville by Josh
Rouse](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00070FV3Y/qid=1141199263/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/104-8898263-5177552?s=music&v=glance&n=5174)

[Illinoise by Sufjan
Stevens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009R1T7M/qid=1141199303/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/104-8898263-5177552?s=music&v=glance&n=5174)

All I need to do now is somehow work in an album by [The
Weakerthans](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004VVWS/sr=8-1/qid=1141232525/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8898263-5177552?%5Fencoding=UTF8).

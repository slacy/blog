[hugin](http://hugin.sf.net), the Open Source Panorama stitching tool,
is now available for [x86\_64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_64),
which means I can now run it on my screaming fast Athlon. Sweet! I went
[here](http://bugbear.blackfish.org.uk/~bruno/apt/) and followed the
"Manual Yum Instructions"

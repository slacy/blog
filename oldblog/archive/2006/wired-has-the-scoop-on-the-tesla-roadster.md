Basically what I was expecting: An electric Lotus Elise (literally). Get
the scoop on the [wired blog](http://blog.wired.com/teslacar/),
including pictures! There's also a [nice article on
wired](http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/0,71414-0.html?tw=rss.index).
I'm sure more will be forthcoming from their [Official
Website](http://teslamotors.com) tonight or tomorrow.

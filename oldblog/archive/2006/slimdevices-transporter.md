They say:

> Slim Devices' Transporterâ„¢ was designed to appeal to the most
> discerning audiophiles and music lovers. It streams digital music with
> sound quality that surpasses even the most exotic compact disc
> players.
>
> At the heart of Transporter is a "no compromise" attitude to component
> selection and electronic design.

My Thoughts:

-   This box is only interesting to people who've ripped as FLAC, since
    the mp3 encoding is going to kill any true audiophile.
-   Dual displays are cool
-   Its a little "bling" for me, even the black version. Less shiny,
    please (but I'll never buy one anyway)
-   Why not put the cool knob on the remote too!
-   Built in wireless bridging! Genious!
-   You guys gotta improve the slimserver software! Its still pretty
    slow to respond to browsing \~5k artists/\~25k tracks, and seems
    like it really needs a rearchitecture! Rescanning my music folder
    takes a *really* long time at 100% CPU usage. I know you can
    do better. Oh, and your memory usage is disgraceful! (Mine is
    running at 163M Virtual, 56M resident, all the time) Its using more
    RAM (Virtual) than any other "service" running on my box. (This
    doesn't include mail & web apps that can be easily shut down).
-   Can the digital inputs be used for "ripping" from optical sources?
-   \$2k?!? Ouch. Is Sonos really that big of a threat?
-   Make a Squeezebox that plays SD & HD video, PLEASE!

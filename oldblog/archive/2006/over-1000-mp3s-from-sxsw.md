The SXSW (South by Southwest) music & film festival is on, and just like
last year, [they're providing bittorrents of all their
music.](http://2006.sxsw.com/toolbox/schedules/ipod/#)Thats nearly 1,000
128kbps tracks from emerging folk and rock artists. Its typically great
stuff, and I think you should give it a try! Keep in mind that the
Release 1 torrent is about 2.6GB, and the Release 2 torrent is about
850MB.

One thing I find a bit annoying is that their web site lists this under
"iPod". Its like you can't play music with any other device. Really
stupid web design, and really stupid attitude towards everything 'pod.
At least they didn't call it something like a "podTorrent". If they did
that, I'd probably refuse to download it from them and send a nasty
message.

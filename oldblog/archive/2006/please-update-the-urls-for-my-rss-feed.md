Hi, I just realized that WordPress has a bug in its generation of RSS
feeds from the link "http://slacy.com/blog/rss.php".  I've moved that
file aside, and made it redirect to the place that works:
"http://slacy.com/blog/index.php/feed"  If you're reading this from an
RSS reader, please change the URL to the feed to be the latter one. 
I'll probably remove rss.php sometime to make this bug go away.  In the
mean time, I'm redirecting.

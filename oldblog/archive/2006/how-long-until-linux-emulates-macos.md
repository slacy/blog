Okay, now that we have an official announcement of an Intel-based Mac, I
want to know how long it will be until the Linux community does
[Wine](http://winehq.com/)-style emulation of Intel Macintosh
applications.

Why do I care? Well, if Apple aren't the bastards that Microsoft is,
this could mean a great set of runnable applications (Office, Photoshop,
etc.) for the Linux desktop! For now, I'll put my blind faith in the
open source movement, and see what happens...

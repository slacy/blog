I always think of this paper as one of my finest achievements in
Highschool. I wrote this short story to keep myself from failing the
Creative Writing class I was taking during my Junior year at North
Andover High. I absolutely despised my teacher, and decided that I would
give her some of the sugary-sweet crap that she always said she wanted
from our story telling. So, I came up with this Twilight Zone-esque
story about a boy named Steve. She made me read it aloud to the whole
class. I almost died.  
One little note: Becky was the name of the girl who had a locker next to
mine, and I had a huge crush on her. Thankfully, I don't think she was
in my Creative Writing class.

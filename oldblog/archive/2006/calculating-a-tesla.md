[Tesla Roadster](http://teslamotors.com) =  
[Lotus Elise](http://lotuscars.com) (\$50,000)  
- Crappy Toyota Engine (\$10,000)  
+ Electric AC drivetrain (\$20,000)  
+ Lithium Ion Batteries (\$10,000)

Will it outperform an Exige? It sure would be cool to see the "Tesla
Cup" in [SCCA](http://scca.org).

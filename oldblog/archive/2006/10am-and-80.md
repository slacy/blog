Its 10am  
Its 80 degrees  
In California.  
This isn't supposed to happen.

Yesterday was already unbearable at over 100 degrees for good parts of
the afternoon, and today isn't shaping up to be any better. This sucks,
because its that sort of "immobilizing" kind of heat. Can't do much
other than lay around on the floor, or go to the mall, or go to a movie.
Ugh. Not again.

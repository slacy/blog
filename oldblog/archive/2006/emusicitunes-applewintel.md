There was an [interesting article in USA Today this
weeken](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/services/2006-07-30-emusic_x.htm?csp=34)
about [eMusic](http://emusic.com), revealing that they've captured 11%
of the total market share for online music. Thats really incredible, I
had no idea they were so popular! Go eMusic!

The thing that I think is funny is that eMusic's market share vs. iTunes
is almost exactly the same as Apple's market share in the desktop PC
(Wintel) world. How ironic is that? Apple being the big bully, and
someone else trying to take them down with a more progressive product.
How ironic!

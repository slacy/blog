Finally! Chatting has been enabled for my gmail account. If you're a
gmail user, look for me online... I think this feature is a much bigger
deal than people are making of it. It really makes it clear that
communication (of both e-mail and AIM forms) is the goal, and a combined
interface makes perfect sense.

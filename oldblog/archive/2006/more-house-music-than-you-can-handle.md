If you're looking for house/dance music, you can get some from [Beats In
Space](http://beatsinspace.net).  They've got gigs and gigs of
downloads, just start mining at
[beatsinspace.net/audio](http://beatsinspace.net/audio).  These are
recordings from a show on [WNYU](http://wnyu.nyu.edu), so most mp3s are
continuous mix, approximately 1 hour long, usualy in 2 parts.  [Voted a
"Best
Of..."](http://www.villagevoice.com/bestof/?page=05_result&categ=Music&id=4895)
by the [Village Voice](http://villagevoice.com). I'm still debating if I
want to download and import these into my music collection.  A 1-hour
long dance mix really throws a wrench in a cool random mix.

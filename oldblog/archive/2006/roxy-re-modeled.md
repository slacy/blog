I came across this great album called [Roxy
Re-modeled](http://www.roxyremodeled.com/) on
[EMusic](http://emusic.com) the other day. Its a whole album of
[downtempo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtempo) covers of all the
best [Roxy Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_Music) songs. Slave
To Love, Avalon, Angel Eyes, etc. Starting at
[BasicLUX.com](http://basiclux.com), there are lots of good links to
more downtempo music stores, ([dogsonacid](http://dogsonacid.com),
[beatport](http://beatport.com),
[newsoundtheory](http://newsoundtheory.com)) but I haven't been able to
find a good place for some free scrapes of this sort of stuff yet.

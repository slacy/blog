If you haven't seen [gapminder.org](http://gapminder.org), you should
take a look at it. Their mission is to make world statistics about
things like population, income, and health, and make it entertaining and
easily accessible. It looks like they recently gave a talk at Google,
because there's a [gapminder video on Google
video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7996617766640098677).

Title: Yahoo!'s sad vision of DRM-free music.

Holy crap. I had saw all the news about Yahoo! selling a single DRM-free
mp3 of a crappy [Jessica Simpson](http://music.yahoo.com/jessicaforyou/)
song. My first reaction was: "Great! DRM-free is the way to go! I hope
Yahoo! doesn't kill [eMusic](http://emusic.com)"

Well, I didn't actually look at the page that sells the song, and missed
two crucial points. Here they are:

1\. You have to choose your "name" to be burned into the song. [One
article I read](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=3360) called it "mashed-up
into the song". I say "digital signature and tracking'ed up into the
song". (NB: The article does mention that 2 people downloaded the same
song and compared them, and they were byte-for-byte identical. For these
2 guys. For this 1 case.)

2\. Its \$1.99. Yes! TWO DOLLARS! For one song! Holy Bejeezus! eMusic.com
costs \$19.95/month, and I get 90 songs. Thats about 22 **cents** per
song. Yahoo is charging almost TEN TIMES more! (for worse music!)

If this is Yahoo!'s vision of DRM-free music, then I don't want any.
Thank you very much. Long live eMusic!

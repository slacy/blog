Title: DVI vs. Component Video?

I've been thinking -- is DVI really the right connection when you have a
system involving multiple video processors going on?

My logic is that most video systems (quality Video Processors like the
[iScan HD+](http://dvdo.com), will have all their internal processing at
10-bits per channel. This is also true of many Plasma TV's, that have 10
or more bits per channel. The problem comes when you have a system thats
doing some digital manipulation of the signal. For example, contrast,
brightness & saturation adjustments. If the inputs & outputs are DVI,
then they get truncated from their internal precision of 10 bits to the
output precision of 8 bits.

Is it possible that by using an analog connection, that a full-precision
signal could be preserved, and result in higher image quality? Think of
this:

\[DVR: Frame buffer at 8bpp\]  
&lt;DVI Connection to Video Processor @8bpp&gt;  
\[Video Processer, internal 10bpp processing\]  
&lt;DVI Connection to TV @8bpp (truncation)&gt;  
\[Plasma TV, internal 10bpp processing\]

Get it? The only advantage of DVI is the pixel clock that allows for a
sharper image, but I'm tempted to think that the precision is more
important than sharpness for this application. Thoughts?

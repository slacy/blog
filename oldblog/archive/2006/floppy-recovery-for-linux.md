I finally popped an old skool 1.44M floppy drive into my PC, and started
to image some of my old floppies. The goal was to recover papers and
things that I'd written in college. Well, most of them are corrupt, so I
needed a reasonable way to image them for later recovery. dd isn't
ideal, because it stops after errors. I needed
[ddrecover](http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/ddrescue.html). Its
able to image broken floppies fairly well, and at least attempt to get
as much data as possible off them. Its not 100% though. If you have
\*anything\* stored on a floppy disk, read it in now and save it
somewhere. They don't last!

Title: NiN's "The Slip" is almost as disappointing as "Ghosts I-IV"

So, I downloaded "[The
Slip](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/arts/music/06arts-THISONESONTR_BRF.html?ref=arts)"
yesterday and listened to it a couple of times. The thing that stood out
the most to me is that not a single song on that album really stuck out.
Its kind of sad, really, that [Trent](http://nin.com) has lost his
creativity. Ghosts was a huge disappointment, sort of the equivalent to
techno-industrial elevator music, and I was really hoping that The Slip
would be the new "real" album. Its marginally better, but still lacks
the punch of the good old NiN days.

Just for comparison, I put on "Broken" just now, and man, is that album
awesome.

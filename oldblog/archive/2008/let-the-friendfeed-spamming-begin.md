Title: Let the FriendFeed spamming begin!

So, this morning I received my first piece of "FriendFeed spam". It
takes the form of an invitation to join a group. The invitation is from
a complete stranger, and doesn't seem to have any reasonable connection
to be at all. I suppose my userid was scraped from comments posted
somewhere else on FriendFeed. The invitation looks like this:

> Message from Lyn:
>
> I'd like to invite you to join the "Typography" room on FriendFeed, a  
> place for us to share and discuss things. I hope you'll join the  
> room. You can check it out here:  
> http://friendfeed.com/rooms/typography
>
> ------
>
> To join the "Typography" room on FriendFeed, visit  
> http://friendfeed.com/rooms/typography
>
> To see Lyn's FriendFeed, check out http://friendfeed.com/flynxs
>
> If you have any questions, please contact feedback@friendfeed.com.
>
> Thanks,  
> Your friends at FriendFeed

And, I briefly looked through "Lyn's FriendFeed" and didn't see anything
interesting -- just lots of marginally weird posts and comments on
things. I didn't investigate to see if the typography room seemed 'real'
or not.

(Yes, I bet if I actually log into friendfeed.com I can find the link to
disable this sort of e-mail notification)

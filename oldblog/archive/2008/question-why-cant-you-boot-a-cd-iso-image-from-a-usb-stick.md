I tried to copy a CD .iso image file to a USB stick and boot it, but it
didn't work. There's esoteric instructions on [the Ubuntu help
site](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick?highlight=%28usb%29%7C%28install%29)
about how to do this, but I don't understand why its necessary at all.

Why can't I just dd an iso image to a USB stick and have it boot
properly? Anyone know?

Guess what?

If you fly United airlines from San Francisco to JFK, you get to ride on
a Boeing 757.  
And, if you get to ride on a Boeing 757 and you have a baby,  
Then you get to find out that a Boeing 757 doesn't have a changing
table.  
And, when you find out that a 757 doesn't have a changing table,  
Then you get to change your baby in the empty seat that you were lucky
enough to have on the flight out.  
But, when there's no empty seat between you on the flight back,  
Then you get to find out what its like to try to change an explosive
poopy diaper in an airplane lavatory.  
And, when you try to change that poopy diaper,  
You follow the advice of the nice flight attendant,  
Who said that you should sit on the toilet,  
With the changing pad in your lap,  
And with the baby on the pad.  
But, the pad gets dirty, and you only have 2 hands, and you've run out
of wipes,  
So you're using toilet paper, and you're putting the used ones in the
sink,  
Which the baby can reach with his arms,  
And your only savior is when mommy knocks on the door and asks if
everything is okay.  
And everything isn't okay, and there's a naked dirty baby in the
lavatory with his clothes half off.  
But thanks for the help! And she cleans up the pad, and you get on the
new diaper,  
And you put on new clothes, and you wipe up all the mess, and you wash
your hands,  
And you say:  
**Screw YOU United Airlines with your ridiculous lack of changing tables
on your Boeing 757s!!!**

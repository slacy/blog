Hey, Internets!

I already read xkcd.

You don't need to post every episode of xkcd to your favorite social
link sharing site {digg, reddit, friendfeed, twitter, facebook,
stumbleupon, etc., etc., etc}.

I now declare that you, the internets, may assume that everyone who
wants to read xkcd is already reading it, and there's no reason to try
to evangelize this great nerdy comic.

(And yes, I didn't even link there, and this isn't about today's comic,
which is quite funny. If this continues, I'm going to have to stop
reading xkcd, because I'll be spammed with links to it from a thousand
different directions, which really isn't that fun.)

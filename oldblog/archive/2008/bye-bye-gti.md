Well, we found a good place to sell our 2 old Volkswagens, and picked up
an '08 Prius last night. Its "Magnetic Grey Metallic" (i.e. dark grey),
has "Package 6" which means "loaded", and we drove it off the lot with
only 1 mile on the odometer!

We've been thinking of ditching the VW's for a while now -- since we
basically only ever drive one car at a time, and its actually a really
great feeling to go down to one car, and to know that it'll get 40+
MPG.

Pulling Isaac in and out of the VW was also getting to be a pain, since
the Jetta has so little legroom, we had the seat mounted in the rear
middle, which meant hoisting a 21 pound kid and 'bucket' into that
middle section. Not fun. The Prius has a \*lot\* more rear legroom, so
we'll be putting him on the side to make it easier to get him in & out
of the car. (BTW, we also bought a "Britax Boulevard" carseat and
"McLaren Techno XT" stroller for our new 'portable' combo. We haven't
yet installed the new seat in the new car, but I expect to do that in
the next few weeks...)

And no, my phone doesn't have bluetooth, so I can't make a receive calls
from the car (yet). I'm contract-free, so that change may be coming
soon-ish as well...

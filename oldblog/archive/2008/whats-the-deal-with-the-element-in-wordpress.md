Title: What's the deal with the <code> element in WordPress?

When I put source code in a &lt;code&gt; block in WordPress:

-   It doesn't preserve indentation.  This is useless for Python code
-   It doesn't allow newlines in the block without starting a new
    &lt;code&gt; element.
-   There's no way to insert a &lt;pre&gt; or &lt;code&gt; block in the
    visual editor interface

I guess I should look around for a source-code syntax-highlighting
plugin for WordPress?  Anyone know of a good one?

[I found this Ted talk by Gever Tulley pretty
interesting](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/202). I'm not
totally sure that I agree with all this stuff, but I do agree that we
live in a way too safety-conscious world. I guess the [Tinkering
School](http://tinkeringschool.com) is nearby? I wonder if it'll still
exist in 6.5 years? :)

NB: I do find [his blog](http://gever.tumblr.com/) a bit pretentious,
with **its** <big>odd</big> changes in <small>size</small> and *font*
all the time. Its **far** <big>too</big> blatent to be *interesting*. It
<under>reminds</under> me of reading a book thats been underlined or
highlighted by someone else. Its far too hard to follow the actual
meaning. (Note that my CSS won't even go to the extremes that he uses on
his site...)

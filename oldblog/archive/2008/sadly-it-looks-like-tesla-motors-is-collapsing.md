I knew that Martin Eberhard was ousted, but I just found out that a
whole host of other key Tesla people have just been axed. [Martin
describes it as a 'stealth bloodbath' in his post-tesla
blog](http://teslafounders.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/stealth-bloodbath/).
In the comments, people are saying that the heart and soul of the
company has been ripped out. This is really, really sad. I wished for a
great electric car, and thought that Tesla was our savior, and would be
the renegade that would break the electric barrier. I'm getting more and
more skeptical -- it seems like Tesla isn't really keeping the EV vision
alive.

Thankfully, Toyota seems to understand the market, and is making some
really great cars. A recent announcement from their CEO said that they
were planning on offering hybrid drivetrains in every car they sell, so
one can still hope for a revolution, but this time from Japan, not from
San Mateo. I've been always a bit put-off by the lack of an all-electric
mode on the Prius, so my real hope is that in the next few years they
finally give us what we've always wanted...

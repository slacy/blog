Here's something that may scare you: Your next car may cost \$6000 more
than your current car cost. At least thats what GM wants you to think,
and they want you to be upset that the Federal Government has imposed
stricter fuel standards. Here's a quote:

> "We've done the research and it's going to cost us \$4,000 on some
> vehicles and \$10,000 on others, with an average of about \$6,000,"
> Bob Lutz told reporters at the North American International Auto Show.
>
> "That cost will have to be passed on to consumers," Lutz, a long-time
> vocal critic of federal fuel regulations, said.

This is strictly preying on the consumer's inability to optimize for the
long term. If an average consumer drives 15,000 miles per year, and gas
costs \$4 per gallon over the 7 year lifespan of that car, then:

@25MPG they would spend \$16,800 on gas over 7 years.  
@35MPG they would spend \$12,000 on gas over 7 years. (Savings of
\$4,800)  
@45MPG they would spend \$9,333 on gas over 7 years. (Savings of
\$7,466)

The real reason GM is complaining is that they're scared that for the
\$6,000 that they're going to spend on making their cars lighter won't
have the MPG benefit of the same \$6,000 that Toyota is spending on
making their cars actually more efficient, and that the GM cars will
average 35MPG and the GM cars will average 45MPG (or more, in the
future).

The irony is that this is coming from Bob Lutz, who's the guy who's
pioneering the Chevy Volt, if you believe that will ever come to
market...</small>

[partyvan.info](http://partyvan.info), the wiki for "The Insurgency" who
[describe themselves](http://partyvan.info/index.php/Insurgency) as:

> The Insurgency, also known as /i/, is the militant branch of
> Anonymous. It does not forgive. Nor does it forget.

Note that "Anonymous" is the group leading the internet attacks on
Scientology (Referred to as CoS on partyvan). They have a page for what
they call [Project
Chanology](http://partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology). The good
part is that they have transcripts of the silly [Anonymous YouTube
videos](http://youtube.com/watch?v=QubW_LhiqDY) there, so you can just
read them instead of listening to the silly computer generated voice.

Is pretty excellent for hours of amusing, random, grammar-less
entertainment. For example, take a look an this [awesome article on
"furries"](http://partyvan.info/index.php/Furry). The hilarious thing to
note here is how they outline in detail all the different types of
furries and why they're so horrible.

If partyvan isn't good enough for you, then you'll have to take a quick
look at [/b/](http://img.4chan.org/b/imgboard.html) and
[/i/](http://img.4chan.org/i/imgboard.html) on 4chan.org (note: NSFW and
pretty offensive most of the time). You'll quickly come to realize what
kind of people the members of Anonymous really are: prepubescent
teenager hackers? Probably. Oh, and if those links are a bit scary (yes,
they are) then the [Wikipedia article on
4chan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan) might make for easier
reading.

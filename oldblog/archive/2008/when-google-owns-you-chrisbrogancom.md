They never said what this Nick Saber guy did to get himself locked out
of his Google accounts. I would have expected him to chime in and say
"well, if you don't want this to happen to you, then don't do X". I have
some guesses as to what X is. Likely, spamming for his business, [Cross
Tech Media](http://crosstechmedia.com), which even by the name, sounds a
bit dubious to me, and the website (which has a quote from Chris Brogan,
the guy who's blogging about this whole incident). Anyway, I don't have
*any* sympathy for this guy. I bet he did something really nasty and
isn't coming clean with the whole story.

Researching the purchase of a new netbook.  Its always good to check up
on the user forums:

[Acer Aspire One user forums  
](http://www.aspireoneuser.com/forum/index.php)

[Asus eee pc user forums  
](http://forum.eeeuser.com/)

[Lenovo S10 user forums  
](http://s10lenovo.com/ "Lenovo S10 user forums")

Any advice on how to choose between these 3 would be appreciated. :) 
I'm planning on running Ubuntu and not storing much data, so an 8GB SSD
would be fine, although I'd prefer 1GB RAM, and most seem to come with
1GB+160GB or thereabouts...

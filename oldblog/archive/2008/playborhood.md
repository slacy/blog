I had previously joined [pamp](http://pampmothersclub.org), but found
their e-mails and lack of focus too much to handle. It felt more like a
micro-craigslist than a parents resource, so I didn't renew our
subscription.

EDIT: Thanks, Chunk for the comment! I should have said that I think
Playborhood looks really awesome, and I totally agree that kids need
more unstructured play time, and the ability to adventure and explore
their local neighborhood, and be able to expand their "safe space"
outside of the home, car & school. I'll look forward to Playborhood
sections for Mountain View, which would be really great!

Okay, so as you know, our kitchen is being remodeled. What this means is
that we're still having periodic power outages at home when they're
doing construction, and that means that slacy.com might not be
accessible 100% of the time.

The [kleinlacy.com](http://kleinlacy.com/gallery) gallery will always be
up, and I'm going to really start getting motivated on moving stuff like
the slacy.com/blog to the hosted server as well...

Sorry!

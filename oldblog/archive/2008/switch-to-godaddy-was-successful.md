Well, all my domain transfers went through yesterday evening. Initially,
everything was working fine, but godaddy decided to point to my old
registrar's DNS servers, and thats not a config that was going to work
for very long.

So, I had to go through and change all my domains NS server info to
godaddy's domaincontrol.com address, which is fine, but when I did so,
it set everything back to their defaults, which is godaddy's parking
service (totally annoying!).

Then I had to manually edit all the NS settings for all the domains to
remove the crappy parking stuff, and set things back to my IP address.

After all that, (and probably about an hour of outage of both web &
email traffic) things appear to be back to normal. Let me know if you
had any issues sending me e-mail, or if you have any issues visiting any
of my other domains.

We were chatting about games today at lunch, and I mentioned [Kingdom Of
Loathing](http://kingdomofloathing.com) as a really fun casual web game
that I had played in the past. I checked the site, and its still up, and
it looks like they still have a really active userbase (I played it \~4
years ago). Before you start, check out this ["What is
KoL"](http://www2.kingdomofloathing.com/static.php?id=whatiskol) page to
get a feel for what the game is like...

It might look a little "junky" at first, but once you get over the
initial hump, you'll find a wonderful game full of insider puns, jokes,
and all kinds of funny stuff, and the drink making and item combination
stuff is really fun, so keep playing until you at least get that far!

When I was playing, there was a per-day turn limit, which at first I
found really frustrating because it meant I couldn't go as far as I
wanted, but then I realized that it kept me from playing hours and hours
a day. There are a couple items that can increase your turns per day
(and drinking in game helps) so don't hesitate, and don't get too
frustrated. Just be glad that you're not wasting your life away trying
to get a meat hat and killing sabre-toothed limes.

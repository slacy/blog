Hi, we're back from our 2 week trip to Switzerland, and I'm sorry for
the blog & website outage.

While we were away, they started construction for our new Kitchen, and
that means that I had to hastily disassemble our networking closet, and
that meant that I lost all connectivity to slacy.com.

Anyway, I'm still meaning to migrate the whole thing over to the new
hosted server (like I did with the gallery, which was still up the whole
time on kleinlacy.com/gallery) but I just haven't had the time to sit
down and do that.

What you really want to see is pictures from the trip, right? They're
still stick on the CF cards in the camera, so you'll have to wait.

Oh, and there are pictures of our demolished kitchen in there as well.
:)

Patience!

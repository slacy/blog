I heard a caller on KQED today reference [next10.org](http://next10.org)
and he mentioned that you could do your own California budget
simulation, and try to balance the budget yourself. Turns out its a
pretty cool little flash application. Check out the [California Budget
Challenge](http://www.nextten.org/budgettool/site/thesim/flashcheck.html)!

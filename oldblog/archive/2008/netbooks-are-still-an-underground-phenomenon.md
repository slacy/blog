Title: Netbooks are still an underground phenomenon.

With all the talk on the interwebs about netbooks, I had assumed that
they had already gone "mainstream", especially since Amazon is saying
that their top sellers are LCD TVs, Netbooks, and the Nintendo Wii.

But, I've been using my netbook at our local coffee shop for the last
few days, and I've found that no one has seen one before, and I've had
two people spontaneously come up to me and ask me about the machine. 
When was the last time you had someone ask you about your computer in a
public space?

People are really surprised at the size (about 8" x 10"), weight (2.2
lbs), battery life (2+ hrs), and price (\$350) .  I mention that it's
not the fastest thing, but the general response is: "well, at that price
and weight, it's worth it!" which is exactly how I feel.

To me, this means that netbooks really do have a place in the market,
and have a long way to go when it comes to marketing and market
penetration.   I think if the marketing engine kicks in on these
machines, or if there's enough word of mouth spreading, that they'll
really begin to take off.

It's as if people have finally had enough of their 3.2GHz multi-core
multi-disk super GPU enabled \$3000 machines, and the thought of
something small, light, and with a reasonable battery at a reasonable
price really strikes true.

Score +1 for common sense!

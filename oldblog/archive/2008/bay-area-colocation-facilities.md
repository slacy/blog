I'm doing research trying to find a good colocation facilitiy in the bay
area. Here are some good leads:

[Layer 42](http://layer42.com): 1U, 512kbps = \$99/mo  
[vr.org](http://www.vr.org/virtual-server-plans/server-colocation/): 1U
+ 1.5Mbps = \$175/mo  
[monkeybrains.net](http://monkeybrains.net): 1U + 1Mbps = \$150/mo  
[fastcolocation.net](http://fastcolocation.net/packages.html): 1U +
1Mbps = \$99/mo (+\$150 setup)  
[servertweak.com](http://www.servertweak.com/colocation/): 1U + 1Mbps =
\$150/mo  
[xo.com](http://xo.com): 4U + 1Mbps = \$306/mo  
[Hurricane Electric](http://he.net): 7U + 1Mbps = \$200  
[ColoCrossing](http://colocrossing.com): 1U + 1Mbps = \$140/mo (1U =
\$65 + 1Mbps = \$75)  
more to come as I find them.

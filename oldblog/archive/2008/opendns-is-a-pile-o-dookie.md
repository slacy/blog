So, I tried [OpenDNS](http://opendns.com) for a while. Until one day I
came home and my wife was complaining that she had spent 4 hours on the
phone with her company's IT department trying to figure out why her VPN
didn't work. She mentioned that sometimes she was seeing the OpenDNS
search page instead of her company's intranet links. So, I turned off
OpenDNS, and everything worked. This is totally unacceptable behavior
for OpenDNS, so I now proclaim that its a huge pile of dookie.

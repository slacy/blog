I had a fantastic idea just now, but it requires Windows to do it:

1.  Download Microsoft [Photosynth](http://photosynth.com)
2.  Download [all the Mars images from Opportunity
    & Spirit.](http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/all/) (NB: Is there
    some package or torrent of all this stuff?)[  
   ](http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/all/)
3.  Create a screencast of yourself using it, so that I can watch it on
    YouTube or elsewhere.

Damn, being a die-hard Linux user is hard, and I need your help!

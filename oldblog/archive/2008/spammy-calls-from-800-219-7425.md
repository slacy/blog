Ever since we bought our new Toyota Prius from Capitol Toyota in San
Jose, CA, I've been getting spammy calls from 800-219-7425.

Generally, it says "This is the second notice that the factory warranty
on your car has expired.  You still have time to renew it, press 1 to
speak with a representative".

I've spoken with them several times telling them to remove my name from
the list and stop calling.  They have not.  I saw another missed call
from this number today (12/26/2008 - the day after XMas!) and decided to
do some research.  I found a couple of interesting websites.  The most
interesting is this [Press Release from the Missouri Attorney
General](http://ago.mo.gov/newsreleases/2008/030608.htm) talking about
what they've done to try to stop these people.

Additionally, if you're getting calls from these guys, take a look at
[telemarketinglawsuit.com](http://telemarketinglawsuit.com/), which
seems to have some good info on the fact that these guys are a huge scam
and are defrauding people left and right, in addition to calling them
incessantly and not removing them from their "do not call" lists.

Additionlly, I think that if you have any business with Capitol Toyota
in San Jose, CA, that you make sure you get them to sign a release that
says that they won't give or sell your personal information to anyone. 
I'm completely positive that it's their fault for putting me on this
list.

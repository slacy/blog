[First, Cognitive Daily had an interesting post about how people
associate sound &
color.](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2008/02/casual_fridays_music_reliably.php)
Their goal was to see if certain musical pieces evoke a (random) color.

[Then, I heard about soundofcolor.com.](http://www.soundofcolor.com/)
(Note: flash & music) Their goal was to create music that evoked a
certain color.

Compare & contrast?

I saw [this article in Time magazine that quotes a half dozen different
child sleep
'studies'](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1728755,00.html)
and it made me really upset. Its full of doom-and-gloom quotes about
childrens sleep habits, when in reality, there is usually very little a
parent can do to settle down a truly fussy baby. We're not having any
trouble getting Isaac to sleep, thank goodness, but I know friends and
coworkers are having issues with their kids.

I just want to say how damaging I think articles like that one are. Its
quotes like this that really upset me:

> Babies who grew accustomed to falling asleep with a parent in the
> room, being held until they fell asleep, or being taken into a
> parent's bed when they couldn't sleep were also more likely as older
> children to have trouble falling asleep and to sleep fewer hours
> during the night.
>
> \[ED: And then in the next paragraph\]
>
> According to a burgeoning body of research, children who don't sleep
> enough may be at risk for health problems later in life. Two
> additional reports, also appearing in the current issue of Archives of
> Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, suggest that children's
> sleeplessness may be associated with an increased risk of being
> overweight and having emotional and behavioral difficulties in
> adolescence and adulthood.

So, in other words, if I let my child fall asleep in my arms, then he's
going to have behavioral difficulties in adulthood? Uh, yeah, right.

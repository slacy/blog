Last weekend, we were doing some party planning for IKL's 1st b-day
party, and ended up at Diddams. I was bored with picking out paper
plates and napkins, and took a sleeping baby over to the toy section,
and was surprisingly pleased by what I found.

The've got a much larger selection of Lego than Toys-R-Us, and they've
got a great organization scheme where there are whole isles devoted to
things like "art", "bathtime", "crafts" and such. They've got a
well-organized book section (the selection could be better, but compared
to T-R-U, it was wonderful). And they've got fun things like Gurdy balls
well displayed and easy to find. You can buy wooden train track by the
piece, and they have a huge selection of Playmobil figures (we're not
quite there yet, though.)

Anyway, I just wanted to share. :) I'd go there just for the toys (and
the distraction-free and nearly kid-free atmosphere). Yay!

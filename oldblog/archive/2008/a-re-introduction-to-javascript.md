I'm just starting to learn and program in JavaScript for some simple web
app development I'm doing at home, and have had a hard time finding a
good reference & introduction to the language and its somewhat quirky
constructs. I found the article [A Re-Introduction to
JavaScript](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
on developer.mozilla.org, and found it really useful, especially the
discussion around functions, inner functions, closures, etc.

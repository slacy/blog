The problem with RSS is that if you mistype your entry the first time,
and then change your mind, some RSS readers (like reader.google.com) may
have already pulled down the feed and have it cached and are serving it
to users. You can go back and edit the feed, but I doubt that they poll
that frequently to check for changes on existing posts.

To make a long story short, after writing my last post, I decided that I
could move the IP address for kleinlacy.com over to the new server. But,
thats the link that I published for the "[old
server](http://slacy.com/gallery). Guess what? It doesn't point at the
old server anymore!

So, to see the 'old' server, go to slacy.com/gallery. To get the new
one, go to kleinlacy.com/gallery.

The content is all mirrored, so they should look identical, but one
should be lightening fast, and the other dull and slow.

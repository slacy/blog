This is totally non-obvious, so here goes.

At a shell prompt, run:

\$ gnome-desktop-item-edit
\~/.local/share/applications/mylauncher.desktop --create-new

Go through the dialog to create the launcher and make sure you give it
an easy to remember name. Â When you're done, that application should
show up under "Applications" in that search thing.

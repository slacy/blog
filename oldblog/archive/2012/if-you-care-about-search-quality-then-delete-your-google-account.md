Google continues to integrate their in-house social media product
Google+ into search results under the guise of "making search social."
 But, they're excluding and demoting results from many other social
networks.

Having a Google+ account active, even if you don't use it, means
you're telling Google that this behavior is OK.  It means you're telling
Google that it's okay to base search results on a dysfunctional social
network.

**To tell Google that you don't support integrating Google+ into search,
you must delete your Google+ account.**

If you keep your idle & inactive Google+ account around, you're becoming
one of Larry's statistics.  He's counting you in the "active users"
count, even though you're not using Google+.  Google will continue to
attempt to optimize it's algorithms to your inactive network.

Deleting your Google+ account is the one and only way to truly send a
message telling Google that you don't agree with their social
integration strategy.  [Do it

Title: Why does it take a new device to get people thinking differently about User Interfaces?

I assert that much of the "innovation" of the iPad is in software, not
hardware, and much of that software is being written outside of Apple.
Companies writing iPad-specific versions of their software are taking a
fresh, new look at User Interface design, and it shows. From what I've
seen second hand, most apps on the iPad are fresh, new, and innovative.

My question is: Why did it take a new hardware device to make this
happen? Things like the 2-column GMail layout (see the [google mobile
blog](http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/04/google-services-on-ipad-and-tablet.html))are
useful across all platforms, on all devices, and via traditional input
methods (i.e. keyboard and mouse).

I appreciate and understand that Apple is innovating in both software
and hardware with their new devices, but it frustrates me that others
(I'm looking at you GMail, Epicurious, NetFlix, etc.) aren't just taking
a fresh new approach to web design across all their properties.   I want
to see these innovations on my phone, on my desktop, and of course, on
the iPad.

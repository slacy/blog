I downloaded the hacked Gawker database to double-check that my e-mail
address(es) aren't in there, without having to submit my e-mail address
to a 3rd party site.  (If you want me to check for you as well, just
e-mail me or find me on Twitter/Facebook).

I also did a quick analysis of all the domain names in the e-mail
addresses.  Here's the breakdown of the top 25 with counts of
occurrances:

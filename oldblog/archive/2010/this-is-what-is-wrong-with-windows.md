I did a fresh install of Windows Vista today, and installed all the
recommended updates. After downloading and installing updates, Windows
would reboot and say that there were more updates. Here's the update
history. Note that all these updates were installed **today**.  This is
totally insane.  Why can't the first "download and install" just update
everything?  Why did I even bother installing from a DVD when clearly,
the entire system needed to be replaced?  Why not just install from the
net in the first place?

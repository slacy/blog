Lots of people are making helper libraries to make the CSS syntax a bit
more user friendly.  Here's a selection of them:

-   [Less (Ruby)](http://lesscss.org/)
-   [CleverCSS (Pythonic)](http://sandbox.pocoo.org/clevercss/)
-   [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

If you know of any others, please let me know.  I'd like to take a look
at them.

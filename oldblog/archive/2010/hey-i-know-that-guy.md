Ok, was writing up the really long version of this story, but here's the
short version.

I was just watching [Nova](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pharaoh/)
/[Pharoh's Boat](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/explore/boat.html),
and saw "[David Vann](http://davidvann.com/), author A Mile Down" and
thought to myself: "Hey, I know that guy!"

I once took a creative writing workshop in the San Juan Islands.  David
was the captain/teacher, and that trip convinced me to crewed his boat
Grendel for a trip south from San Francisco.  We were supposed to go
through The Canal, but most of the crew bailed in Acapulco, because the
boat was nearly in disrepair, and it's hydraulic rudder system was
clearly failing.

The story I had heard about Grendel's fate was that the hired captain
(not David) and a couple of crew continued south until both the engine
and rudder broke, and then they hobbled into some crazy Central American
port, and then they too abandoned the boat, and left David to clean up
the mess.

But, I hadn't heard that David had made a career of writing stories
about his sailing mis-adventures.  His book "[A Mile Down: The True
Story of a Disastrous Career at
Sea](http://books.google.com/books?id=duwdZiclyAcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+mile+down&ei=QV9NS7O-OZuWlQTpwazqDw&cd=1#v=onepage&q=grendel&f=false)"
mentions Grendel and the Mexico incident several times.  Use the search
box on the left to search for
"[Grendel](http://books.google.com/books?id=duwdZiclyAcC&lpg=PP1&dq=a%20mile%20down&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=grendel&f=false)"
and you'll see.

And, you can find [more accounts of the
trip](http://www.arts.gov/features/writers/writersCMS/writer.php?id=08_08)
on arts.gov, the site of the National Endowment for the Arts.   The
abandoned boat he mentions is clearly Grendel, especially the part about
the captain who ruined the engine.  (She was driving the boat hard
because of David's insane time schedule for getting the boat to the
BVI.  With virtually still air all the way from SanFran, there was
nothing more she could do to meet his demands.)

Anyway, here are some photos of the boat and her crew:

The woman is the hired captain, and the other guys are the crew.  Sorry,
I don't remember anyone's names.  That photo was taken at a somewhat
posh yacht club in Acapulco, Mexico.

Here I am aboard David Vann's Grendel.  Circa 1997.

Digital photos were taken with my "state of the art" 1MP Kodak DC120
camera.  [There are a couple more photos of Grendel and sailing
here](http://kleinlacy.com/gallery/v/1997/album108/).  Note that the
pictures are in no particular order.

After I abandoned Grendel in Acapulco, I headed to visit my sister on
the east coast, then spent 3 months traveling in Ireland, France and the
Netherlands.   Go figure.

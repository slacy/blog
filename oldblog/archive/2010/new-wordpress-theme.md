I'm now using the latest "Twenty Ten" WordPress theme on my blog.
 Mostly, because I got tired of how the other one looked, and this is
the latest greatest theme from the WordPress developers.

Let me know if you like it.  Or, let me know if you never visit
slacy.com because you always read this via RSS. :)

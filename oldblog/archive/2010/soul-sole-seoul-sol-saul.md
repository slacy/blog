-   Soul
    -   Like in religion.
    -   Like in music.
    -   Like the car by Kia.
-   Sole
    -   Like the fish
    -   Like the bottom of your shoe
    -   Like "The only one"
-   Saul
    -   The man's name
    -   In Hebrew : "Borrowed"
-   Sol : Sun in Spanish
-   Seoul : The city in Korea
-   Shoal : Not really pronounced the same

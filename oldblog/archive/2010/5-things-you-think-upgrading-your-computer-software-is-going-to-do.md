When you upgrade your computer's OS or some big program, you're always
doing it for a reason. Â Here they are:

1.  Upgrading is going to support the drivers for that new device you
    just got. (Sorry, it won't.)
2.  Upgrading is going to make your computer faster. (Really?)
3.  Upgrading is going to make your computer crash less.
    (Actually, more.)
4.  Upgrading is going to make that one program not hoze your whole
    system anymore. (That program has been removed from
    the distribution.)
5.  Upgrading is going to give you lots of great, new features. (You
    really think things have changed that much?)

My wife and I have been watching episodes of the TV series each night. 
It's really well done, but there are lots of questions after each
episode.  Here are a few, broken down by element:

### All elements

1.  Does bending take human energy or magic energy?  For example, does
    creating fire burn "calories"?  If so, do fire benders need to
    consume extra food?  Is it possible to be "too hungry to bend?"  If
    it takes "magic energy" to bend, then what is the source of this
    energy?  Is it finite or infinite?
2.  Is there a limit to the amount of bending one can do in one
    session?  Do you get "tired" if you bend a lot?  Do you get "sore"
    from a lot of bending or training?

### Fire

1.  Why do the fire nation ships bellow smoke?  Couldn't they just have
    some benders down there creating flames for their boilers?
    (Presuming the ships are steam powered)
2.  Can fire benders extinguish fire, or just create it?
3.  If fire benders can extinguish fire (remove energy) can they cool
    any object?

### Water

1.  Exactly what constitutes "Water"?  Clearly both sea water and fresh
    water count.  Additionally, frozen water counts.  What about other
    liquids, or other frozen forms?  Alcohol or alcoholic beverages? 
    Glass?  Other crystallized substances?
2.  Can water benders bend blood?  (If so, this would be a very
    dangerous and powerful skill.)
3.  What about water vapor? (i.e. natural humidity that's in the air). 
    Can a water bender pull liquid water "from thin air" by acting like
    a dehumidifier?
4.  What about water contained within living cells?  Can a water bender
    extract all or some water from a living plant or animal?  Instant
    food/meat dehydration is one use case, and another is obviously a
    very deadly weapon.
5.  Can water benders bend wet or waterlogged substances like Jello,
    Mud, a wet towel or wet rope, etc.?
6.  We've seen water benders turn water into ice (removal of energy) and
    ice to water, and this implies that they can heat and cool water to
    any degree (i.e. produce boiling water, hot steam, etc.).  Is this
    true?

### Earth

1.  Similar to water:  What constitutes "earth"?  Rock? Dirt? Metal
    ore?  Refined metals?  Naturally occurring noble gasses?
2.  Is mercury (the element) earth?  What about other substances that
    occur naturally in the earth, like oil, natural gas, uranium, etc.?
3.  Is lava earth?   Can earth benders turn rock into lava?

### Air

1.  Similarly, what constitutes "air"?  Is it any gas?  Nitrogen gas? 
    Oxgen?  What about Helium, Hydrogen, Xenon, or other rare gasses?
2.  Can an air bender create a vacuum? For example, can you suffocate
    your enemies by encasing them in a vacuum bubble?
3.  Why does Aang need his glider?  With air control, he should be able
    to fly without it, and seems to do this every once in a while. 
    What's the point of the glider?
4.  Can an air bender heat (and cool) air?  If so, then how is this
    different than the fire bending ability?

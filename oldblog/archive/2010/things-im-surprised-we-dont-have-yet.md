Title: Things I'm surprised we don't have yet

-   Wireless everything.  Why is my A/V receiver such a mess?  Why isn't
    this stuff all wireless yet?   If not wireless, then why not some
    "universal" audio+video cable, similar to HDMI, but with a lighter
    form factor.  Why not USB, ethernet, or optical?  Why do I still
    have to plug in my phone to charge it?
-   Batteries that last for months or years for portable electronics.
    This would be more about power consumption than storage, but still
    feels like batteries have stagnated.  Remember when Alkaline
    batteries first came out?  It was \*huge\*.   Lithium is a little
    better, (and rechargeable) but in general the number of watt-hours
    per battery is fairly constant.
-   Fast internet connections.  It seems like the United States has been
    stuck at \~1Mbps down \~512kbps up for easily 5+ years now.   Why
    isn't this 100Mbps symmetric?
-   Super high resolution displays.  In 1990, my main computer was an
    IBM PS/2 with a 16Mhz i386 processor, 4MB RAM, and a 15" CRT screen
    that was 1024x768.  In 2009, I bought a new computer (netbook) that
    runs at 1.6GHz (100 times faster) 2GB RAM (500 times more) with a
    screen that was 1024x768 (the same size!).   Why doesn't my screen
    have at least 10x the pixels that it did in 1990?
-   Video on demand for everything.   Going to digital broadcast sure
    freed up a lot of valuable airwaves.  But wait, why are we
    broadcasting video over the air at all?  The DVR has existed for 10
    years now.  Isn't about time we just time shift everything?  Live
    events (sports, etc.) could be live-streamed. I should be able to
    watch any episode of anything that's ever aired on TV or any movie
    ever produced, at a moments notice.  Why isn't this true yet?
-   Cars that don't suck.  Why do car's suck so much?  Even the most
    modern car out there (arguably, the latest generation Toyota Prius)
    is still a mess of gears, oil, wires, and fairly crappy and old UI
    conventions on the inside.   Where's my hyper-modern fuel-efficient
    transport vehicle?  Why do I still have to carry around a spare tire
    and jack, jumper cables, tire chains, etc.
-   Better locks for my home.  My car will unlock itself when I touch
    it, and will start without me putting the key in the ignition.  But,
    I have to carry around a small lump of metal to stick in a tiny hole
    to enter my home.  Why isn't this better?

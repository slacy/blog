I've heard that GoDaddy is a pretty crappy DNS service. Generally,
people seem to complain that their origin DNS servers are quite slow.

I have observed that every once in a while, I do get quite slow DNS
resolution of my GoDaddy hosted domains, and would switch if there was
an easy (and free) alternative.

I'm surprised that OpenDNS and Google Public DNS don't let people add
their own DNS records for their domains.  This seems to me like a
natural extension to the services they're providing.

I'd love to hear if you have any alternatives to GoDaddy that are "known
better" in their response times, and that are reputable and reliable.  
Self-hosting DNS has always seemed like a bad idea to me, but it could
be an alternative if the arguments for it are strong enough.

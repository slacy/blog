Tomorrow is the inevitable release of the Apple iTablet iSlate iPad
iWhatever.

Generally, I don't follow this iHype, and it mostly makes me frustrated
at how easily Apple can whip up the online tech community into a frenzy.

But, I'm genuinely interested in watching Jobs' presentation on this
thing tomorrow.   Why?  Because I'd like to see how he's going to
position it.  From what rumors I've read, this thing could be any one of
the following:

-   **A media device**.  It sits in your living room, streams from
    iTunes video, and replaces your TV with a close-range viewing
    device.  You can download videos to it and view them on the go.
-   **A phone**.  It has 3G, works with Verizon, Sprint or AT&T (2 or 3
    different models?).  Comes with a bluetooth headset and you use it
    pretty much like a giant iPhone.  But wait, I need a second monthly
    fee for the wireless on this thing too?  Can I tether it to my
    iPhone for 3G connectivity?  Can I do that over bluetooth so I don't
    have a cabling nightmare when I'm on the go?
-   **An input device for your computer**.  It's a keyboard, touch pad,
    and LCD display all in one.  It sits beside your computer giving you
    extra screen real estate, connects via bluetooth, presents itself as
    a  keyboard and Mouse.
-   **A way to run iPhone apps "on the desktop."** But wait, it's not on
    my computer desktop, it sits physically on my desktop and runs
    applications, and talks to my computer via wireless.
-   **An e-reader**.  You can download books from the new "iTunes book
    store."  It competes directly with the Kindle and Nook.  It stores
    textbooks (for college students use).
-   **A portable gaming machine**.  It's like an iPhone on steroids, and
    it mostly focuses on applications that need more screen real
    estate.  Web browsing (of course) but games also need more real
    estate to be compelling.  What will the battery life be like with
    full 3D accelerated games running?
-   **A really great phone**.  But wait, it won't fit in my pocket.  How
    does it interact with my iPhone?  Am I compelled to carry both? 
    Does it come with a slipcover, backpack, or otherwise?
-   **An off-desk web+email device**.  For when you want to read e-mail
    and surf the web, but either you don't have a desktop, or you're
    doing it in the kitchen, living room, or bathroom (and want a bigger
    experience than your iPhone.)

The thing is, I think the device will be **all** of the above, and I
think that's hard to sell.  It has too many functions.  Jobs is always
selling a lifestyle.  He wants to sell you "With the iPad, you can
\_\_\_\_\_".  It needs to be simple and succinct and easy for anyone to
understand.  Both the iPhone and iPod were billed as "great" versions of
existing devices.  What is the iPad a great version of?   I'm not sure,
and that's what I'd really like to hear. I think it's going to be a
beautiful device that's hard to pin down.  I think everyone is going to
say that it's "revolutionary" and then realize that it doesn't quite fit
into any niche. I think "Too big for my pocket, too small for my desk."
is going to be the unavoidable ultimate conclusion on this thing.

I had these instructions written up in about 2002 (at least that's the
timestamp on the HTML) and I've since nuked that section of my site, so
I'm replicating it here.  If you want that "simulated HDR" look in your
photos, here's an easy way to get it:

1.  Create 3 layer copies of your original photo.
2.  Set the top layer mode to "Saturation"
3.  Set the middle layer mode to "Overlay"
4.  Desaturate the middle layer
5.  Invert the middle layer
6.  Gaussian Blur the middle layer with a large radius blur (10-20% of
    your maximum image dimension is a good choice.)
7.  Duplicate the middle layer if you want "more effect"
8.  Adjust the middle layer opacity if you want "less effect"

This technique will bring up the levels of the dark parts while not
blowing out the dim parts.  It'll do it in a way that's much more subtle
than "levels."   If you duplicate the millde layer 2-3 times (or more)
you'll get that funny high-contrast HDR-look from a single photo.

I'm not saying it's the way you wan to your photos to look, but to each
his own.

For example, you can easily go from this:

to this "Simulated HDR" image:

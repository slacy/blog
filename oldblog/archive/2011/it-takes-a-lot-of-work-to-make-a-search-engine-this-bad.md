Compare the search term to the 1st result in the following:

As best as I can tell, they're purposely demoting their own search
results to the second slot. I'm not seeing similar issues with 3rd party
applications.

The thing is, these are some of the best apps on the market, and they're
purposely making it hard/confusing to easily install them. Why? Are the
1st slots paid?

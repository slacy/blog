Something the other day reminded me of metafilter.com, where I have a
login (this costs money now?) and I've had an account since 2002.  Like
all **good** websites, they won't nuke your account if you don't log in.

That made me think of my match.com login, and the "good old days" of the
Internet.  I signed up there very early, and when they transitioned to a
for-pay model, they sent me an e-mail saying that I was signed up for a
"lifetime" subscription.  Sweet!  I'm married now, happy with 2 kids,
but it's fun to log in and see what my old profile page says:

So, just logged in (had to recover my password via e-mail, which
amazingly worked) and checked the status.

Yup, no monthly fees, member since **6/5/1995**.  Folks, that's almost
14 years ago!  Holy shit!  Imagine the number of system upgrades and
migrations that my account has gone through!  Imagine the number of
developers there saying "jeebus, I wonder if this guy will ever log
in".  Or, "I wonder if he's still single".

Well, congratulations to you, match.com.  I'm impressed by your
commitment to "free lifetime service" and I'm impressed that you've
continued to port my account forward through what must be several system
upgrades.

Cheers to the old single me days of 1995, and cheers to the new
father-of-two me of 2009. Who ever would have thought?

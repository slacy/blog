Title: Uplink speeds...

It's amazing to me how saturating, or even near-saturating the uplink on
my DSL has a **huge** effect on the perceived downlink speed.  I'm
running a big backup right now, using \~512kbps of my \~768kbps, and
it's totally killing my downlink speeds.

Maybe it just kills latency of the downlink, and not speed?  I haven't
run speedtest.net to see.

Anyway, it's things like this that *really* make me want to switch to a
cable modem.  If it just didn't involve selling my soul to Comcast...

\#3412: The Visual Editor is ass slow on my 2.4GHz dual-core AMD box. 
WTF?  (Nevermind how it performs on my netbook...)  For some reason,
backspacing is particularly slow. WTF!?

\#2968: Why can't I embed arbitrary HTML?  I want to embed an
&lt;object&gt; tag with some flash in it.  Why won't WordPress let me do
this?  Isn't that exactly what the HTML editor is for?  Sheesh!  (And
yes, I'm super-annoyed with how it "syntax checks" my HTML and munges
things after I submit my post.  WTF!?

I'm the only search result for ["has many new features such as
labels"](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=%22has+many+new+features+such+as+labels%22)

So, the funny thing is that I didn't think that phrase was very unique,
and yet, WordPerfect 5.1 is the only thing that has many new features
such as labels!Â  (And well, now this blog post does, so click while you
can, and don't forget to view the [HTML

of the PDF file!)

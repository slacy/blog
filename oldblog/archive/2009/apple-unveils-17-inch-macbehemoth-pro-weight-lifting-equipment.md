[AppleInsider | Apple unveils 17-inch MacBook Pro with 8-hour
battery](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/01/06/apple_unveils_17_inch_macbook_pro_with_8_hour_battery.html).

Or, more appropriately titled:Â  Apple flips the bird to the concept of a
'netbook'.

Apple's new laptop:

Is 3 times heavier than the average netbook.

Has 3.75 times more pixels onscreen than a netbook.

Has 3.5 times the CPU of a netbook (single 1.6GHz Atom vs. Dual 2.93GHz)

Has a screen that's almost 2 times larger than an 8.9" netbook.

Has 4 times as much RAM as a netbook.

Has 2 times as much disk space as a netbook.

Lasts the same amount of time on battery as a 6-cell netbook. (i.e. Acer
Aspire One)

Oh, and did I mention that it costs about **EIGHT TIMES** as much as an
average netbook?

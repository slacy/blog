As far as I can tell, there are no
[RRDTool](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/index.en.html) bindings for php5
for Ubuntu 9.04.Â  It appears as though it existed in prior distributions
that included php4, but Ubuntu 9.04 no longer includes php4.

Several others are talking about [compiling it from
source](http://www.ioncannon.net/system-administration/25/how-to-build-the-php-rrdtool-extension-by-hand/),
but this seems very wrong and unnecessary to me.

If you have any other information about how to easily via apt-get make
RRDTool functions work in php in Ubuntu 9.04, please leave a comment
here.

[I'm not sure why this has to be so
complicated.](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/contrib/php_rrdtool.txt)

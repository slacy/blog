It's easy to install lots of great Android applications that end up
eating up all your standby battery power refreshing.

Big culprits are the FaceBook application, and any Twitter clients that
you may be using.  When you install them, they generally come with a
very aggressive and frequent update interval.  These updates will really
shorten your phone battery life.

Personally, I prefer to just manually update these messages, and all
these applications usually include a "Refresh" option to manually
refresh their data.

So, disable those automatic FaceBook notifications (or set them to a
very long amount, like 8 hours), and use the "Refresh" menu option
instead!

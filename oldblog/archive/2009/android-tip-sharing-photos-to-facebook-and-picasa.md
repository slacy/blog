A lot of the UI on Android is sort of hidden, but it's really powerful. 
Here's how to share photos to FaceBook or Picasa.

1.  Use the camera to take a photo.
2.  After taking the photo, a small version of it will appear in the
    upper right corner, tap on that.
3.  You should have a few options appear, one of which is "Share".  Tap
    on that.
4.  Select how you want to share the photo, each of which will have it's
    own UI for sharing.  I like FaceBook.
5.  Add a caption in FaceBook and click "Upload"
6.  Done!

A very similar process works for sharing videos onto YouTube as well!

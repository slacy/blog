Title: I rank higher than Google itself.

Search for "s3 fuse" on Google.com, and you'll find that my blog post
about s3fs is ranked higher than the link to code.google.com where you
can actually download s3fs itself.  Weird.   I'm omitting links from
this post so that I don't bias my own search results on those posts. :)

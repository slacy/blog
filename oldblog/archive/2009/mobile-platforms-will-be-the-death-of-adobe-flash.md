I've been curiously watching the developments (or lack thereof)
surrounding Adobe and the use of Flash on mobile platforms like the
iPhone and Android handsets. Here's my summarization of the situation as
it stands today:

-   No browser (mobile or otherwise) has Flash built in.  All browsers
    require a "plugin" provided by Adobe to play back Flash content.
-   Mobile browsers are behind the times when it comes to plugin
    support, but even though, Adobe isn't providing mobile phone
    manufacturers any sort of mobile flash experience. (FlashLight
    excepted, but this isn't on major mobile platforms)
-   Adobe got the short end of the stick when it comes to Flash.  Their
    playback platform powers the worlds largest sites (youtube.com) but
    they don't see a dime of revenue from it's popularity, because most
    users consume flash content but don't produce it, and flash
    producers are who Adobe has previously marketed their products to.
-   In all likelihood, Adobe wants to be paid for porting Flash to
    platforms like the iPhone and Android.  I don't think that either
    Apple or Google would have any part in paying Adobe for such a
    "right" to use flash.  As proof of this, I present the YouTube
    non-flash applications on iPhone and Android, which offer a rich
    non-flash experience that could easily make it's way back to the
    desktop browser.

Assuming that Adobe stands fast, and Flash never becomes an integrated
part of the mobile browser platform, and, as the mobile platform base
grows, sites that rely on Flash for their user interface will be locking
out the mobile browsing platform.  So, these sites will realize that
they would reach a larger audience if they offered a non-flash
mobile-friendly experience.  Thus, they'll port their flash user
interface to AJAX, which works on both desktop and mobile browsers.  
Flash usage will begin to decline.  As Adobe gets more anxious to
squeeze the dollars from Flash, then the free mobile-supported
alternatives will arise.  Greater use of SVG graphics, more AJAX, and
possibly even some open-source flash-like technology that will be free
and usable for mobile browser developers.

Did I mention HTML5's &lt;video&gt; element?

Did I mention ViXimo?  This is just the beginning of mobile-enabled
flash alternatives, and proof that the above is coming true already.

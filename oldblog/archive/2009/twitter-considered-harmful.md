Okay, so I've been trying to use Twitter, and I've decided that it's
damaging the internet.  Here's how:

-   Mostly arbitrary and irrelevant 140 character limit.  This only
    applies to SMS users, which I believe there are very few off.  All
    hardcore people either use m.twitter.com, a regular browser, or a
    custom client for their (i?) phone.  Arbitrary per-character limits
    are so 1990's.
-   bit.ly (and other link shorteners) links that are required duo to
    the 140-char limit inevitably lead to "what the hell am I about to
    click on" syndrome.  If we didn't have the totally arbitrary 140
    char limit, this wouldn't be an issue and we could use regular
    URLs.  Being [Rickrolled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_roll)
    every once in a while is fun, but frankly, I want to see what I'm
    clicking on most of the time.
-   Lack of markup.  Again, the 140 character limit makes it impossible
    to have reasonable (any?) markup and thus, all links are in
    plaintext, etc.  This sucks and is more like the internet from the
    1990's.  I'd like to use markup instead of \*bold\* and /italics/
    and \_underlines\_ please and thank you.
-   @foo syntax (@ = in reply to) are beginning to appear on other
    sites, and have little to no meaning in most contexts.  I frequently
    see "@myfriend" style wording in other sites, forums, blog comments,
    etc.  This is unacceptable, as the syntax pretty much blows except
    for when using twitter.com, where the "@" links actually become
    active.  When I don't know who the "@" is actually referring to,
    it's doubly pointless.  Things like "@barakobama way to go dude!"
    are also pointless.
-   \#foo syntax.  Essentially the same argument as the previous one. 
    Don't do this, and, the "\#" sign is actually useful in some
    contexts.  For example, if you tweet "I got \#1 at the trivia
    contest!"then the "1" is a hotlink to searching for the tag "1"
    which is totally pointless.
-   Passive followers see nothing but a noisy one sided conversation.  I
    really don't actually want to hear my friends saying "@importantguy
    Your socks rock in my boots!"   Especially when I don't know
    "importantguy" and I could care less about your socks.  Thanks for
    trying.   Following most people on twitter reminds me of the feeling
    of listening in to someone's phone conversation on the bus or
    train.  Pointless.
-   Lack of interoperability.  Twitter is essentially a closed network
    and won't interconnect with any other microblogging sites like
    laconi.ca, or Facebook status messages (although many sites like
    loopt, will gateway messages into Twitter, and others like
    [Friendfeed](http://friendfeed.com) and
    [Facebook](http://facebook.com) gateway messages into their own
    walled gardens).  This is unacceptable.  Interoperability is key.
    (take Jabber as an example).
-   Search?  Everyone is abuzz with trying to solve the "Twitter Search
    Problem".  For me, this is back to the 140 character limit.  If an
    average word is 7 characters and search terms are 2 words,
    (14 characters) then this is already going to be **10%** of the
    resultant matches.  Is this "term to result" ratio really useful?  
    Since twitter messages are so inherently content-free due to lack of
    space, then why is searching useful?
-   Shrtnd txt b/c of the arbtry 1hundrd frty char lmt.  Ths has drct
    impct on srchablty snce cmmn wrds & trms wnt appr in twits
-   Just another userid and another login to another site
    (twitter.com).  OpenID please?  Why do I have to craft a new
    identity for myself **again**? A new username? A new profile pic? A
    new password? No thanks.
-   [People who want to be followed by zillions of other people for
    seemingly
    no reason.](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/25/kevin-rose-10-ways-to-increase-your-twitter-followers/)
-   No one has anything interesting to say anyway.
-   Very poor archiving.  In contrast, this blog is a great archive of
    my life, my thoughts, and the things that mattered to me over the
    years.  Am I really going to want to read "@wifey: Heading to the
    store, I'll pick up some tampons for you." in 10 years?  In 10
    minutes?
-   The proliferation of "sidecar" twitter sites is staggering.  These
    sites offer "extra features" like links (bit.ly)
    pictures (twitpic.com) or external twitter search or news sites
    (twitter.alltop.com), etc.
-   The "Twit" / "tweet" naming scheme pisses me off.  See twitpic.com,
    snaptweet..com, twitxr.com, etc. for examples.

One problem you might find if you send all your e-mail to your phone is
that you're constantly getting the "new e-mail" notification, and that
means it becomes sort of useless, and you'll begin to ignore your inbox
(again).

The best solution to this is to create a set of filters for your e-mail,
and apply labels to messages you don't want to receive notifications
for.  What other e-mail programs call "Folders", are referred to as
"Labels" in GMail.  (Although, unlike folders, one message can have
multiple Labels)

One other thing you'll need to remember is that GMail uses the term
"Archive" to mean "Remove from your inbox".  Archived messages are only
visible through the Web UI and searches.  Think of it like "I'm done
reading this but I don't want to delete it."

There's a fairly easy way to set up Filters & Labels built into GMail:

1.  Go to your GMail Inbox
2.  Select a bunch of related messages (from a mailing list, of a given
    topic, etc.) that you'd rather not receive notifications for on
    your phone.
3.  Click on "More Actions" in the top bar of buttons, and pull down to
    "Filter messages like these"
4.  Make sure that the list of matching messages looks correct to you
    and click "Next Step"
5.  Select the "Skip the Inbox" and "Apply the label" checkboxes.  Use
    the dropdown to create a new label if you'd like.
6.  Click Create Filter

Done!  Now, all messages that are of the type you selected will skip the
inbox (be automatically Archived) and will also get the label you
selected.

By default, the GMail application on your phone only sync's your Inbox,
but you can always view other labels on your phone, and you can even set
up syncing for those labels as well.   You can view messages with any
label by pressing Menu from inside the GMail application, then selecting
"View Labels"

To set which labels are sync'd to the phoneOn your Android, run the
GMail application, and...

1.  Press Menu
2.  Select "Settings"
3.  Select "Labels"
4.  Find the labels you want and set the sync durations for
    those labels.

If you find that your phone often says "Lodaing..." when viewing your
Inbox, then you need to sync more days of your Inbox.

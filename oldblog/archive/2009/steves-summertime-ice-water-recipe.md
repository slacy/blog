Never thought you needed a recipe for Ice Water, did you?  Well, did you
ever think that maybe you could make a *better* ice water drink?  I call
this one an H~2~0 Martini.  Read and learn!

Ingredients
-----------

-   32oz wide neck Nalgene bottle, any color.
-   Whole cube ice (not crushed), at least 2 full trays worth.
-   Water

Directions
----------

1.  Crack ice and fill Nalgene bottle to the very top with ice.  If
    you're using ice from an ice dispenser, you may need to put the ice
    in a cup first, and then into the neck of the Nalgene first to
    prevent jamming of the ice dispenser.
2.  Fill the nalgene about half way with water.  You can use either tap
    cold water, or chilled water if you have some.
3.  Close the lid of the nalgene and shake vigorously.
4.  As the ice melts slightly and settles, there will now be room for
    more ice.
5.  Open the Nalgene bottle and put in as many more ice cubes as
    you can.
6.  Fill to the brim with water (tap or chilled)
7.  Close the lid of the Nalgene, and shake vigorously.
8.  Enjoy!

Notes:
------

You can enjoy your ice water directly from the Nalgene bottle, or you
can pour it into smaller glasses, but note that these will warm up more
quickly, so drink fast!

The Nalgene makes a good contact body cooler as well.  Because the
plastic exterior conducts heat (but not too well) you can do things like
place a bottle of ice water on your feet, between your legs, under your
arms, or anywhere on your body that seems like it needs to be cooler
than it is now.   Rotate bottle periodically for a boost of coolness!

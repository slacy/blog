> To make common yncke of Wyne take a quart,  
> Two ounces of gomme, let that be a parte,  
> Five ounces of galles,  
> of copres take three,  
> Long standing dooth make it better to be;  
> If wyne ye do want, rayne water is best,  
> And as much stuffe as above at the least:  
> If yncke be to thick, put vinegar in,  
> For water dooth make the colour more dimme.  
> In hast for a shift when ye have a great nead,  
> Take woll, or wollen to stand you in steede;  
> which burnt in the fire the powder bette small  
> With vinegre, or water make yncke with all.  
> If yncke ye desire to keep long in store  
> Put bay salte therein, and it will not hoare.  
> Of that common yncke be not to your minde  
> Some lampblack thereto with gomme water grinde.

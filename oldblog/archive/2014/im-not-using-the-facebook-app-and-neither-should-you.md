Given that the Facebook mobile app has continued it's unprecedented
increase in required permissions, I've decided to stop using the app
altogether.

Funny thing is, the mobile interface available on facebook.com is just
fine, and gives me pretty much everthing I want from facebook these
days, which isn't much.  In fact, in many ways its superior, as it
doesn't require continual app updates, on-device storage, background
data syncing (battery drain and data usage), and doesn't generate
annoying notifications.

I'm even inclined to say that it's actually **better** than the facebook
app for those reasons.

You should ditch the facebook app too.

    "There are many tutorials for Tensorflow on the internet, but I found that most of them (including ones included in the [Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/)) take a \"top down\" approach, usually starting with running an MNIST classifier on a pre-existing data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "These top down introductions are useful for people who have a dataset in mind, and who are ready to apply existing ML models to new (or existing) datasets, or for people who want to get a 10,000 foot view of what ML is and how it's applied in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Top down approaches aren't at all suited for those who would like to eventually gain a deep, thourough understanding of thesystems involved.  "

    "Hello and welcome to *TensorFlow from the Ground Up*!  \n",
    "I'm Steve, I'm an experienced Software Engineer, and I'm learning [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of mystery, speculation, and promise in the field of Machine Learning, and as an engineer, my goal is to answer several big questions about ML in general: \n",
    "\n",
    "> How do I determine if I can solve a specific problem using Machine Learning?  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Which problems will it work for, and which ones will be a failure?  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> How do I design an ML graph from scratch? \n",
    "\n",
    "For me, these are extremely important questions, and most tutorials I found were lacking this type of low level deph and context. \n",
    "\n",
    "I found many tutorials for Tensorflow on the internet, but most of them (including ones included in the [Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/) itself) take a \"top down\" approach, usually starting with running an MNIST classifier on a pre-existing data set downloaded from the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "These top down introductions are useful for people who have a specific dataset or application in mind, or for those who are ready to apply *existing ML models* to new or existing datasets.  They're also useful for people who want to get a 10,000 foot view of what ML is and how it's applied in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Top down approaches aren't at all suited for developers who would like to gain a deep, thourough understanding of the systems, processess, and APIs involved.  "

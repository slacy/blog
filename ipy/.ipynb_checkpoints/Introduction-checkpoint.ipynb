    "Hello and welcome to *Tensorflow from the Ground Up*!  I'm Steve, and I'm an experienced Software Engineer, and I'm learning [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org).\n",

    "One of the biggest questions that I had was: \n",
    "\n",
    "> How do I determine if I can solve a specific problem using Machine Learning?  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Which problems will it work for, and which ones will be a failure?  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> How do I design an ML graph from scratch? \n",
    "\n",
    "These are extremely important questions, and most tutorials I found were lacking this type of low level deph and context. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tutorials for Tensorflow on the internet, but I found that most of them (including ones included in the [Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/) itself) take a \"top down\" approach, usually starting with running an MNIST classifier on a pre-existing data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "These top down introductions are useful for people who have a specific dataset or application in mind, or for those who are ready to apply *existing ML models* to new or existing datasets.  They're also useful for people who want to get a 10,000 foot view of what ML is and how it's applied in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Top down approaches aren't at all suited for developers who would like to gain a deep, thourough understanding of the systems, processess, and APIs involved.  "

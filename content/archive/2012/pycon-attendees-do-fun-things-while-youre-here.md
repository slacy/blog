Hey, so, you're in town for PyCon and you're staying at or near the
Santa Clara Convention Center.

Your first reaction is: Ugh, is this really as cool as Silicon Valley
is?  The answer is NO!  Of course not! Santa Clara is kind of the armpit
of the valley, so it'll kind of be a shame if that's all you see.

Get out of there and go visit someplace!  It's fairly easy to [get to
Downtown Mountain View via the light rail](http://g.co/maps/z6e5x) that
stops right there in front of the SCCC.  It's a bit slow (45 minutes)
but if you don't have a car, it's a cheap & easy option. Mountain View
is ***much*** more representative of what Silicon Valley is really like.

Downtown Mountain View has some great restaurants, all within easy
walking distance of the train station, and most are open late.  Here are
my suggestions:

-   [Xanh](http://xanhrestaurant.com/):  Great Vietnamese.  Even if you
    don't know Vietnamese cuisine, you'll still have a great meal with a
    cool atmosphere
-   [Shabu Way](http://www.shabuway.com/test/): A japanese style
    "hotpot" restaurant.  You'll get a huge plate of raw beef and a
    boiling pot to dip & cook it in.
-   [Molly MaGee's](http://www.mollysmtview.com/): A fun
    Irish-style pub.  Great beer selection and traditional pub fare.
-   [Red Rock Coffee](http://www.redrockcoffee.org/): The upstairs is a
    virtual incubator of early stage startups.  You'll be sitting right
    next to all kinds of cool people.  Chat it up if you dare.
-   [Sushi Tomi](http://www.sushitomi.com/): The best sushi restaurant
    in Mountain View
-   [Cascal](http://www.cascalrestaurant.com/site2011/index.asp): A
    really fun atmosphere spanish tapas restaurant
-   [Kappo Nami
    Nami](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kappo-nami-nami-mountain-view): A
    great Kyoto-style japanese restaurant.
-   [Tied House](http://tiedhouse.com/): Another good local brewery.
-   [Taqueria La Bamba](http://www.labambamexicanrestaurants.com/) or
    [Los Charros](http://www.loscharrosrestaurant.com/):  Both are great
    taquerias (casual mexican restaurants) that have their own
    rabid followings.
-   [Fiesta Del Mar Too](http://www.fiestadelmar.com/): An awesome
    regular mexican restaurant.

These days, Mountain View is full of early stage and well-known
startups, and if you listen carefully, you might find that you're
sitting right next to someone really, really cool.

If you have a car, and can drive a bit, the following things are worth a
quick drive-by:

-   [Google Headquarters](http://g.co/maps/ksh6a).  Walk around.  Visit
    the Dinosaur, bask in everything googly.
-   Historical marker Signs in front of the
    [Shockley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley_Semiconductor_Laboratory) (391
    San Antonio Rd., Mountain View) and
    [Fairchild](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor) (844
    Charleston Rd., Palo Alto) buildings.
-   The [HP
    Garage](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/about-hp/history/hp-garage/hp-garage.html).
-   [YCombinator](http://ycombinator.com/contact.html)

And if you have a few hours to kill (and a car), I'd recommend:

-   [The Computer History Museum](http://computerhistory.org)
-   Stopping in at [Hacker Dojo](http://www.hackerdojo.com/) to check
    out another interesting incubator.  It's open to the public. Bring
    your laptop and \$10 to hack for the day.
-   [Fry's Electronics in
    Sunnyvale](http://www.frys.com/template/isp/index/Frys/isp/Middle_Topics/H1%20Store%20Maps/sunnyvale/).
-   [Halted Specialties Corp](http://www.halted.com/).  Everything a
    hacker/maker needs!  Surprus electronics & components like you've
    never seen before!

That's my short list.  I'm sure there are a million other things to do,
so feel free to comment and I'll update the post with other suggestions.
 See you at PyCon!

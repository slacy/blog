My post titled "[Things I'm surprised we don't have
yet](http://slacy.com/blog/2010/02/things-im-surprised-we-dont-have-yet/)"
was posted to [hackernews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1159256)
yesterday, got a little voted up, (I saw it around position \#30 on the
homepage), and of course, I got some traffic.  Thankfully, I'm hosted
offsite, although I think my DSL line could have likely absorbed this as
well.  Here are the traffic and bandwidth graphs.  First, here's Google
Analytics:

And second, here's the bandwidth graph from my hosting company.  (Time
goes to the left in this graph, which is oddly reversed from most
graphs)

That graph is sort of a lie, because there are several other domains
hosted on this machine, but you can clearly see the hump created by
something, so let's just assume it's being posted on hackernews.

Hopefully, you guys will stick around and I'll have some more
subscribers.  :)  And even more hopefully, some of you guys (and girls)
are parents, and will sign up on [Parents
Guild](http://parentsguild.com)!

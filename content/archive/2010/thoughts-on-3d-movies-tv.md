I've seen a total of two 3D movies in my life:

1.  Avatar
2.  Toy Story 3

<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">In
both cases, there were several points in the movie where I thought:
"Hey, is this still in 3D?" and I lifted up the glasses to see how much
"depth" there really was.  Upon lifting my glasses, viewing the blurred
screen, and putting the glasses back on my face again, the 3D illusion
returned.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: medium;"></span><span
style="font-size: large; line-height: 27px;">I think the mind has a
pretty strong ability to synthesize depth information, and that we don't
see things as "flat" just because they're being projected on a flat
screen.  Similarly, when affronted with grossly exaggerated 3D effects
from cinema or 3D TV, our brain compensates, bringing those images back
into our normal range of experience.</span>

<span style="font-size: large; line-height: 27px;">These two factors:
synthesizing depth for 2D movies, and clamping exaggerated depth in 3D
movies, work in opposite directions, netting out to the fact that there
is very little benefit for an actual 3D movie or TV viewing
experience.</span>

Title: Like likes but with Analytics?

Lots of social networking sites (FaceBook, FriendFeed, Google Buzz,
etc.) have a "like" button that lets you share content with other
users.  Usually, these services offer a way to place the "like" button
directly on pages that you own, so that you can propegate these links
into the social networking services.

But, when they do this, they don't usually offer a single centralized
location to show analytics about who's clicking on these "like" buttons,
where they're coming from, etc.  For example, if I own domain X.com, and
I put FaceBook Like buttons on every page, I want to be able to go to a
single location to know things like :

-   What's my most "liked" page
-   How many likes have I gotten today (this week, this month)
-   What are the entrance and exit pages for people that click on the
    Like button?

It seems to me that none of the big players are operating in this
domain, and it's really frustrating!

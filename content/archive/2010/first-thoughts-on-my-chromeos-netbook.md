Thanks to a very, very gracious friend inside Google, I received a
ChromeOS netbook in the mail on Thursday, and have been using it as my
primary laptop ever since. (It's replacing a well-worn Lenovo S10
netbook).

First off, I'll have to say that this is a nicely designed piece of
hardware. It's about the right size (keyboard is more comfortable than
the Lenovo, and I have big hands) and I like the jet-black design. I
also really appreciate some of the small details, like the revamped
keyboard, and the way it automatically powers up when you open the lid.
(Yes, it will actually turn itself on if opened, as well as resume if
suspended). The resume from suspend time is great, and I wish all my
other devices were this fast.  Battery life is really excellent, and
does seem to be in the 8+ hours of actual usage range.

As for the functionality, well, it's basically the same as Chrome on my
old Atom-based netbook. It feels a little faster than the Lenovo, likely
because of the SSD and newer processor.  It does web browsing, e-mail,
etc well.   Contrary to what I've seen elsewhere, it plays YouTube flash
videos and most other flash things just fine.  Hulu works, but there's a
little framerate stuttering.  Maybe I've got low expectations for flash
because I usually use flash on Linux, so I'm used to things sometimes
not working.

The screen resolution (1280x800) is fantastic, and a huge improvement
over the 1024x600 of the Lenovo.  It feels pretty much like a regular
laptop in this respect.

There are a couple of things that are a little quirky, like the
two-finger scrolling.  It works sometimes, and other times just doesn't
work at all, or is kinda jumpy.   Also, it seems like the "palm
detection" of the larger trackpad isn't great, and the cursor will
sometimes move while typing.  If/when this results in an accidental
selection, then work is lost, which pretty much sucks.

That's it for now!  More thoughts in a week or so...

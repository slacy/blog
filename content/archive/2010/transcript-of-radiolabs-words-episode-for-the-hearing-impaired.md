When I heard the Radiolab episode
"[Words](http://www.radiolab.org/2010/aug/09/new-words-new-world/)" on
their [podcast](http://www.radiolab.org/feeds/podcast/), one of the
first things that came to mind was sharing the story of the deaf
children in Nicaragua with a deaf friend of mine. Â I spent a few minutes
trying to find a transcript on their website, and as far as I could
tell, there was none. I sent them a quick e-mail a few weeks ago, and
today they responded, with a link to a [full transcript of the
show](http://www.radiolab.org/2010/aug/09/transcript/)!

Huge thanks to Tim at Radiolab!

I spent this evening executing an idea that I had a few weeks ago, after
looking at [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and
[LessCSS](http://lesscss.org).  The idea is this:

Don't write CSS.  Write Python, and then output it as CSS.

The advantages are that you can do-away with all the annoyingness of
CSS, and gain all the fun of Python.  Variables? Check! Functions?
Check! Lots of fun syntax and code/style reuse? Check!

I committed it to github, so you can go check it out there.  It's called
[pyssed](http://github.com/slacy/pyssed).  Take a look at the README, as
well as the source code in examples.  I'd love to hear your feedback.

Hi all,

Just a quick note letting you know that I've turned off AIM chat support
in my current GMail window.  The reason is that it seemed to be making
all chats unstable, and I only very infrequently use AIM chat.  If you
need to contact me via chat, please contact me via GMail chat at my
e-mail address. Thanks!

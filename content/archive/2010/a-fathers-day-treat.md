Andrea's out with the kids, and I'm at home doing *whatever* I want!

So, that means using the new Google Command Line interface (googlecl) to
upload 40GB of videos from my computer to YouTube.  I suspect it'll take
over a day, possibly longer, but is progressing well.

You can visit [My YouTube Account Page](http://youtube.com/stephenlacy)
to see the videos as they arrive.  If you find anything objectionable or
just bad (there are lots of these) let me know and I'll delete them.

Happy Father's Day everyone!

Okay! More [Google Video](http://video.google.com) news! Its now
switched from requiring a player download, to doing all the playback in
Flash! There are a bunch of other minor UI tweaks, but new users won't
really notice.

I don't have a new favorite video yet, so I'll just point at [Why I Love
Shoplifting From Big
Corporations](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5357056239817178301&q=shoplifting)
again. Rock on!

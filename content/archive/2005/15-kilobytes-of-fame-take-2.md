Got 15 more kilobytes of fame again today!!

Same as last time, I got an e-mail that looked really suspicious, which
appeared to be from Microsoft telling me about the Zotob worm and that I
should run the attached virus removal software (clever e-mail,
actually). I took the attachment and sent it to clamav, and it was
identified as Trojan.Downloader.Small-748. Yay! I'm a virus defender!

[Here's a link to the ClamAV.net
post](http://lurker.clamav.net/message/20050824.204604.70c20960.en.html)

P.S. if you get a message in your e-mail that says "What You Need to
Know about the Zotob.A Worm", then DON'T CLICK ON THE ATTACHMENT.
Sheesh!

Maybe we should just amend the e-mail spec to disallow attachments. :)

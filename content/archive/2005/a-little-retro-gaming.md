So, we've been looking for a good, fun multi-player no-gimmicks party
game for a really long time, with the side goal of finding a good fun
2-player puzzle or adventure game. About a year ago, we visited a
friends house, and played "Dr. Mario 64" on their Nintendo 64, and
really liked it. Great fun, easy to pick up, good handicapping system,
great game overall. Well, this weekend we went out and bought an N64 and
Dr. Mario at the used game store. I'll have to say that this nearly
decade-old game system plays wonderfully. Dr.Mario is a fantastic game.
The low-res graphics give it a great retro-pixellated feel. I don't
think there's been anything close to this good in a long time.

I also picked up a copy of "Conkers Bad Fur Day" for the N64. I'd seen
reviews for it a long time ago, and it looked like a really great game.
I'm happy to report that its surpassed my best expectations of a
cartridge-based platformer. Its got full dialog, wonderful sound
effects, and the graphics are actually quite good. Think of Super Mario
64 on steroids. I haven't played something this engaging in a really
long time. Its fun, its silly, and it plays well.

Why can't current game designers get it right? Why do they spend all
their time on graphics polish instead of on solid gameplay?

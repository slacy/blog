First, some background. One of my "daily" websites that I visit is the
Yahoo "[Most
Popular...](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=index&cid=964)" pages.
I find it an interesting mix of news articles, photos, and just an
interesting barometer of what the 'net is thinking about. In general,
there's a running theme of "cute person" that includes actors,
actresses, models, gymnasts, volleyball players, etc. Its interesting to
see what people think is alluring in a news story...

Anyway, so I came across one tooday, and it got me thinking: Has Yahoo!
become Not Safe For Work (NSFW)? I mean, check out the following two
"Most Popular" photos:

["Model Adjusts Blue Transparent
Shirt"](http://us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20040921/i/r603933930.jpg)  
[Model walking down the runway away from
us.](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/040920/photos_lf_afp/040920233719_lwqvhkym_photo2&e=4)  
[An actress arriving somewhere. (or
something)](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/040920/ids_photos_en/r983831091.jpg&e=8)  
[A bikini
model.](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/040921/ids_photos_en/r4106601505.jpg&e=14)

Do you think these sorts of pictures are really appropriate for Yahoo to
have in their news section? Is it freedom of speech? What right do they
have to censor Reuters news content? Why is Reuters providing these
photographs?

There was another picture that was much more striking, but it seems to
have been pulled. I'll take another look for it later this evening.

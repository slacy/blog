Title: HotSpots that are for stealing passwords?

I wonder if this is happening:

Take a Linksys WRT54GS, make it an open wireless access point, and then
load it up with fake versions of all the popular websites -- a fake
hotmail.com, a fake gmail.com, a fake mail.yahoo.com, a fake
wellsfargo.com, etc. Put it somewhere where lots of people are, say, at
a University or by a Coffee Shop. Every time someone connects to one of
your spoofed sites, and types in their password, log it to the internal
flash memory. If people are accessing a non-spoofed site, then just pass
it straight through to the original site (or not, if you don't feel like
it). Then, come back later and collect all the passwords.

Is this a common practice? It would be indistinguishable from the "real"
sites, because you'd spoof the DNS, https, and everything. I'm not sure
there's any way you could tell the spoofed sites from the real ones.

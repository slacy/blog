I've been spending the last few evenings scanning some family slides
from long ago. Here's the interesting thing: The slides span a 30-year
period from about 1945 to 1975, and if it weren't for the markings on
the paper sleeves themselves, I'd have no clue when they were actually
taken. We're talking generations here -- I can't tell the difference
between pictures of my sister as a child, and pictures of my mother as a
child. The slides look *identical*.

The point I'm trying to make is that there was an entire generation
(generations?) where this was the technology of choice. It didn't
change. It was a constant in the world, and life was good. If you wanted
high quality photos that lasted a long time, you used Kodachrome slide
film and a good quality rangefinder camera. No questions asked.

Now, its 50 years later, I'm scanning slides because I think I'm
"preserving" them, but are my grandchildren going to be able to decipher
them? Where will technology be in another 50 years?

Thankfully, someone had the forethought to write on the slide jackets
who the people were, and what year it was taken.

Maybe I should start putting all of our names and locations in the EXIF
tags of the photos I take with my digital camera. :)

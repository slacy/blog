So, I've been thinking about getting a new TV, and was having a really
hard time visualizing the different TV sizes, and figuring out what size
was bigger (and how much) than my current set, which is a 5 year old 32"
EDTV set. Although the term "EDTV" didn't exist at the time I bought it.
Anyay, I digress. Now, may I present you...

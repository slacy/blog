I was thinking today about what it would take to make a car that got 100
miles per gallon, and decided to do a bit of math and comparison work.

First, let's start with the existing Toyota Prius. Its got a 75HP
(combined gas & electric power) engine, gets about 50mpg @ 60mph (1.2
gallons per hour) or 61mpg @ 35mph (.575 gph), and uses a "hybrid"
technology that directly couples a gas engine with an electric engine.

If we wanted a car that could sustain 100mpg @ 60mph, we'd have to use
only .6 gph. City mileage would be increased by things like regenerative
breaking, etc. I'm mostly doing the math for the continuous case of
sustained highway driving. The other cases are easily optimizable.

So, let's take a look at commercially available power generators that
use about that much fuel, and figure out how much power we get from
one.  
The [Honda
EB6500](http://www.hondapowerequipment.com/ModelDetail.asp?ModelName=eb6500)
has a 389 cc engine and makes 5.5kW. At full load, it uses 1.25 gph. At
half load (2500 W) it uses a nice .66 gph. This is getting pretty close
to our target, but its producing less power per gallon (between 3.7kWh
and 4.4kWh) Let's see what else we can find.

Even better is the
[EB5000](http://www.hondapowerequipment.com/ModelDetail.asp?ModelName=eb5000)
that makes 4.5kW and uses .795 gph to do it. At half load (2.25 kW) it
uses a trim .554 gph. Thats between 4 and 5.6kWh per gallon. Thats
pretty good, and is in our usage range.

The last engine I'll consider is a [Yanmar powered Diesel
generator](http://www.generatorjoe.net/SpecSheet.asp?ID=1507) that makes
3.5kW and uses 0.9 gph. At 50% (1750W) uses only 0.5 gph. So, this
engine is making between 3.5kWh and 3.9kWh per gallon of diesel.
Unfortunately, thats not gonna cut it.

So, coming back to the Honda EB5000, we learn that to make 100 mpg @ 60
mph, we need to be using say, 2.5 kW. Thats a whopping 3.3 horsepower.
The question then becomes: How do you design a car thats aerodynamic
enough to need only 3.3 horsepower?

One of the great shows to premier this season (thus far) is
"[Fearless](http://www.olntv.com/nw/article/mdview/?tf=TonightOnOLN_show.tpl&Limit=1&mt=3&f1=UserDef3&UserDef=true&d1=FEARLESS)"
on OLN. It's a series of 1-hour documentaries about people who have come
through extraordinary circumstances. The 3 episodes that I've seen so
far have been about a base jumper, a girl who got bitten by a shark, and
a woman who spent 6 weeks alone at sea after her ship was nearly
destroyed in a hurricane. Its full of inspiring stories from people who
have survived the worst, and come out better. Set your TiVos.

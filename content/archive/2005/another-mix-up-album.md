Okay, now things are getting serious. The genre has a name, and its
"Mix-Up Album." The latest one (thanks to
[BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/21/meet_the_beastles.html))
is a mixup of the Beatles and the Beastie Boys, called "The Beastles". I
like what they've gone, which is essentially set Beastie Boys lyrics to
the background of the Beatles music. This is more of a Beastie Boys
remix than it is a true mixing of the two albums.Â  Very little of the
original Beatles remain. Anyway its pretty fun, and you can get it

Now, back to pondering if the web is the vehicle for producers, mixers,
and DJs. Is it? Is this the way to get your 15-megabytes of fame?

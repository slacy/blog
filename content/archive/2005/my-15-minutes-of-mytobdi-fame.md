Title: My 15 minutes of MyTob.DI fame

Just a quick update -- 4 more messages slipped through today, even
though I'm on the 2-hour update regime. I think the limiting factor here
has become clamav's response time, not my update time. On clamav.net,
there are a couple links to german sites talking about the rate at which
different virus scanners responded to the Sober worm. Clamav was in the
top 3 on all the lists, so thats comforting, but the disturbing thing is
that I think they were all averaging between 7 and 8 hours to respond.
Thats unnerving, because I'm recieving literally hundreds of copies of
these viruses in that sort of timeframe. I wonder what it takes to make
that number faster (on average).

So, I got an unclassified suspicious message at 8:16pm PDT today. It was
titled "\*DETECTED\* ONLINE USER VIOLATION" and looks exactly like every
other MyTob variant. I went to clamav.net and used the online submission
engine, which has an always up-to-date copy of the virus signatures. It
didn't recognize it, so I submitted it using the online submission form.

In the mean time, I got other versions with different subjects at
8:40pm, 9:38pm, 10:33pm and 12:14am.

At 12:05am, I got the message saying that my submission had been
processed, and I checked the [clamav
updates](http://lurker.clamav.net/list/clamav-virusdb.html) page, to see
what its status was. It turns out I was the *first* person to identify
MyTob.DI. I feel sort of
[proud](http://lurker.clamav.net/message/20050615.070207.7e4987f2.en.html),
and sort of disturbed that the viruses are hitting my machine so early
in the spread cycle. Maybe I'm underestimating how quickly these are
spreading, and hopefully I'm not on some "hot list" of machines to hit.

I'm also grateful to the clamav writers and maintainers for keeping my
system clean, and keeping on top of things so quickly. A total of under
2 hours between when I got the message and when a signature was
available. Good work!

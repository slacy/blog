Well, I got cyrus, postfix, spamassassin and clamav to all agree to play
nice together, and that means that my old server has been powered off.

Mail has been transferred to my new RAID5 array, and we're up and
running!

The beauty of it all is that my new system, which is easily 4 times
faster than the old one, is impossibly quiet, thanks to all the
recommendations that can be found on

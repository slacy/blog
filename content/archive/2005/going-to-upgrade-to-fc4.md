Okay, so it appears as though my FC1 installation (or was it FC2?) has
reached its "end of life" as I'm not getting any more updates from the
yum repositories. I guess this is their way of making me upgrade. So, I
figured I may as well go "whole hog" and just get FC4 Test 2, which if
it mirrors what the Fedora Project has done in the past, will be a
production quality release. I wonder what all the new cool stuff is?
Anyone out there upgrade to FC4 yet? I hope I don't blow my weekend on
this...

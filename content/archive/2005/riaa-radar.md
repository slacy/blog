I had never thought of this before, but not all record labels are part
of the RIAA. So, with that in mind, I present you with ["RIAA
Radar"](http://riaaradar.com/), which is a website that tracks bands and
labels that are "RIAA-safe" in that they are not members of the RIAA.
The great part about this site is that they have "top 100" lists, and
will link directly to amazon.com for purchasing the albums. Pretty cool.
(Also, as a great source for independent record labels and artists, you
can then find the artist & label sites directly, and see if they have
any .mp3 files to download.) Cool!

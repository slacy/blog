Have you ever tried to run a program under Wine and gotten a bunch of
errors, missing DLLs, and junk like that?

Well, this is actually a very common problem. It stems from the fact
that a vanilla wine install is actually missing the vast majority of
DLLs required to run many Windows programs. There's a great tool called
(surprisingly) WineTools that installs some scripts that make it easy to
install some important components, DLLs, The Microsoft Installer (.msi
installer), fonts, and a bunch of other things.

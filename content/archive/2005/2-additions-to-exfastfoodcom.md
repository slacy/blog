I finally was in Berkeley, it was daytime, and I had my camera, and I
drove by the two places that I've been meaning to take pictures of for a
really long time. These are going to be added to my
"[exfastfood.com](http://exfastfood.com)" collection. What I'm
collecting is photos of businesses that are set up in buildings that
used to be fast food (or chain) restaurants.

This is a donut shop thats in an old Taco Bell building.

If you know of any other businesses that are housed in fast food or
chain restaurants, please comment here with their addresses, or e-mail
me a photo and the name of the business, and I'll put it on
[exfastfood.com](http://exfastfood.com)!

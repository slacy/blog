Now that my server has (mostly) been converted to my new Athlon 64
machine, and my desktop is 100% converted, I'm living in a 64-bit world.
Everything's great (really, I can't tell much of a difference).

The biggest problem is that there isn't a version of [Macromedia
Flash](http://macromedia.com) for x86\_64, which means I'm living in a
flash-less world. This sort of sucks, especially since I can't see
[Google Video](http://video.google.com) at home anymore. (Of course, it
still works on my 32-bit work machine, but thats at work.). The remedy
suggested by several 64-bit users is to maintain 2 versions of
[Firefox](http://getfirefox.com). One 32-bit, one 64-bit, and only have
the flash plugin installed on the 32-bit version.

I don't think I care enough to go through that trouble. (yet)

Maybe Macromedia will compile a 64-bit version someday, or there will be
an open source implementation that will end up working. Who knows. Both
of those options are probably years away.

Update: I just got [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics)
running on my blog, tracking data, but the whole Aanlytics interface is
basically 100% flash. Ugh. This sucks, since I was hoping that google
would be replacing awstats any minute now. (Actually, I nuked awstats a
long time ago because so many worms seem to be trying to exploit
security holes in it).

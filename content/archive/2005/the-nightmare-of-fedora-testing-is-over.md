Well, I finally spent the time this weekend to upgrade my machine to
Fedora Core 4 release. Thank God. I'm finally off that awful Fedora Core
4 Test 3 release, and on to something thats production. Just to recap,
Test 3 was a nightmare because...

1\. Many packages were missing or non-existant when I installed it,
leaving my system in a completely non-usable state.

2\. Once installed, the updates to packages was relentless. There were
new versions of almost everything on a weekly basis. Many times, the yum
repository was in such a bad state that packages couldn't be updated
because of bad dependencies in the repo itself. I can't believe that
they let it get that bad, and for so long (weeks).

3\. No warning or reasonable behavior for transitioning from FC4T3 into
FC4 Release. There was no warning, no message no nothing that said
"okay, we've frozen the repository, and there will be no updates until
FC4 release." What happened was the freeze happened, but there was no
notice given, and packages continued to change. Later on an "oh by the
way..." message was sent out saying that the repo was broken, and this
was okay because they had transitioned to FC5.

4\. All the annoying people on the fedora-devel mailing list. You guys
all need to chill out. Week long threads about the virtues and ills of
"Top Posting" are rediculous. You're like a bunch of 13 year olds.

There, I said it. Never ever again will I go to a Testing release of
Fedora Core, and I may never install FC on any new machine ever again.

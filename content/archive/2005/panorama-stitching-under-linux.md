Wow!

I finally got a set of Panorama Stitching tools to work under Linux!
Yay! This is super-cool, as I was up at Tuolumne meadows (Yosemite) last
weekend, and took a great panorama of Cathedral Lakes. The full panorama
is stitching right now, but you can see a draft copy here:

The tool I'm using is called [hugin](http://hugin.sf.net) and works like
a charm. Just find the link on that site that gives you all the RPMs for
your system, install and run "hugin". Oh, and they have Windows and
MacOS X versions as well (I won't mention the Free BSD. Thats just
crazy).

Now, I just need to figure out how to hold the camera level while I'm
taking large panoramas like this one.

Right, I totally forgot about this one -- [The
Kleptones](http://kleptones.com/) (who brought you the "[A Night at the
Hip-Hopera](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/downloads_hiphopera.html)")
have released another mash-up, this time called "[From Detroit to
J.A.](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/downloads_fd2ja.html)"  I give it a
solid 2.5/5.0.  Its average.  Nothing special, nothing really stood out
at me.  Sort of just the same old tired mash-up formula doing its work
here.  This makes me realize that even if you spend hundreds of hours
(or more) on an album like this, that it just doesn't mean that its
interesting.  There are some interesting references, especially the
stuff from the Mooninites from Aqua Teen Hunger Force, but thats about
it.  If you're going to download it, make sure you use the torrent link
and a nice BitTorrent client.  Don't kill their poor server.

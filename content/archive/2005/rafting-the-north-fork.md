Check out these pictures of our rafting trip a few months ago. The guy
in Orange is our guide (falling out and getting pulled back in) and both
Andrea and I have on yellow slickers. Fun! We went with [W.E.T. Water
Rafting](http://raftwet.com/), and I was quite happy with the service.
The guides were really great, and we seemed to be having a much better
time than the other rafts around us.

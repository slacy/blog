<a href="http://www.throwingmusic.com/freemusic/">With "Free Music"
50FootWave is seeking new earballs. We thought it'd be interesting to
ask for your energy & enthusiasm rather than your money and see what
happens. To that end, please share this music in any and every way you
see fit. Burn CDs, post the mp3s, seed Torrents -- whatever's
comfortable for you.

It's an experiment. Who knows how it will go? Wheee!</a>

So, I was reading [Annalee
Newitz](http://www.alternet.org/authors/2188/)'s (from [The
Metro](http://metroactive.com/)) most recent post about [Google
Maps](http://maps.google.com/), and she brought up the stuff about
[Barbara Streisand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand)'s
[legal
scuttle](http://www.californiacoastline.org/streisand/lawsuit.html) with
[californiacoastline.org](http://www.californiacoastline.org/) (you can
find the offending picture
[here](http://www.californiacoastline.org/cgi-bin/image.cgi?image=200405715&mode=sequential&flags=0&year=2004)).
It made me wonder if I could find Barbara's house via the Google maps
interface, and wonder if she was pissed off about everybody now knowing
exactly where her outrageous mansion is. Well, without furthur adieu,
[here is a Barbara's
house](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.014906,-118.791325&spn=0.007467,0.007939&t=k&hl=en).
Its the one in the middle with the funny shaped pool.

I've been playing around this evening with an installation of [Gallery2
RC2](http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=166&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0).
It seems really great. I haven't spent time to get things to look like I
want, but it seems much more customizable and configurable than Gallery
1. If all goes well with my current project, I'll try converting my
whole collection to Gallery2 and see how that goes.

As it stands, I'm re-thumbnailing 250 images and its taking half an
hour. Ugh. Fortunately, they're high-res slide scans, 24Mpix each, so
its reasonable that the resizing is taking a while. I'll post a URL to
the photo collection (which is family photos from 1944 to 1979) when its
looking a bit better.

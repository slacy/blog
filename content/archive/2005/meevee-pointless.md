Okay, so driving back from San Francisco this weekend, I saw a giant
billboard for [meevee](http://meevee.com) near the airport. I went to
the site to check it out, and entered my zipcode and TV provider. I
found the following:

<li>
It pegs the CPU of my 2.4 GHz machine and freezes all my browser windows
for 10-30 seconds for every page load. I presume this is because its
laying out all 400+ channels of DirecTV into one giant table. Nice
moove, guys. Time to learn AJAX.

</li>
<li>
Its nothing more than TV listings with advertisements.

</li>
<li>
Even the mildly entertaining features like "Most Popular" are based on
Neilsen data, instead of the user-supplied ratings. Blah.

</li>
<li>
I like the way it looks, its just horridly slow.

</li>
<li>
Why would I ever use this if I have TiVo?

</li>
<li>
"Interactive" flash-based ads in the corner are mildly interesting,
mildly annoying

</li>

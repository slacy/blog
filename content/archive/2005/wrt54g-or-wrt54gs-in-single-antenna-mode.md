Just a quick note:

If you have a WRT54G or WRT54GS, you should check out the
[SVEASOFT](http://sveasoft.com/) firmware, pay the \$20/year, and get
the pre-release "Alchemy" firmware. Its qute good, and contains all
kinds of cool features, like QoS and included hotspot (that has to be
manually configured)

But, note that if you want to use a single high-gain antenna, it doesn't
really work. I bought a single Hawking Hi-Gain 6dB antenna, set the
router to only use one antenna port, and checked my signal strength. It
was fairly low. Attaching one of the included antennas boosted the
signal strength, even though it was set to "single antenna" mode. I
don't understand why, but it could be a bug in the sveasoft firmware.

Anyway, if you think you want to attach a high gain antenna to a WRT54G,
then I suggest that you get two. I have another on order, and will
report back on how well it works.

Well, another one slipped through today. If you've seen all the Mytob's
so far, they send e-mails with things like "Account Alert" "Account
deactivated" etc., with a message to go and change your password or
reactivate your account. I got a chuckle when I saw this message today:

    Dear user gallery,



    You have successfully updated the password of your Slacy account.



    If you did not authorize this change or if you need assistance with your account, 

    please contact Slacy customer service at: [email removed]



    Thank you for using Slacy!

With an attachment called "accepted-password.zip" I like the touch of
the "Slacy Antivirus" at the bottom. Very clever. So, I took the
attachment, and submitted it to clamav.net. It was not a known virus.
We'll see if/when it makes it to the clamav updates page.

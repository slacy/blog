Just heard about this from a friend: [Roku](http://rokulabs.com) has
announced an all-in-one (speakers & media player) device. I like this in
principle. I just hope they got the details right: High quality
speakers, not too big in size, good remote control, and good wireless
connectivity. Oh, and price. It can't be too expensive. :)

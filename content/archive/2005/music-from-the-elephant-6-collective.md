I was reading a description of the band "The Apples in Stereo" and they
were described as one of the members of the "Elephant 6 Collective". So,
I did a google search, found elephant6.com, and found their music
section. I think the part about the "Collective" just means that they're
all on the label Elephant 6. Not sure. Anyway, supposedly they all think
that Brian Wilson (of the Beach Boys) is their inspiration. I can see
it, but this is thouroughly modern music.

I also learned that they've got a bunch of bands I already like,
including the The Apples In Stereo and Beulah (a great bay area band)
There's almost a Gig of music on their website, mostly live tracks of
varying quality, and a few studio demo tracks (John Peel Sessions, etc.)
that are quite good. I think I'd still categorize them as "for fans
only" but if you're not a fan of Beulah, you should be, so go out and
get their albums, and then download this stuff. Its good, and its free.

Well, I put up another website tonight. Its called
[exfastfood.com](http://exfastfood.com/) and its a place where you can
submit pictures of businesses that are in buildings that used to be fast
food restaurants. The 3 most recognizable restaurants that I have
thought of are Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and IHOP. Fortunately, there are
examples of each of these 3 in my neighborhood, so I went out and took
some pictures today, and made the site. Spread the word!

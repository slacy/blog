Title: Really cool "Newspaper" web UI design.

I just got sent an article thats on a site called the [International
Herald Tribune](http://iht.com). The content of the article isn't that
big of a deal, but the really cool thing is the way its displayed. Take
a look at this example: [an acticle about New
Orleans](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/19/features/arch.php).
Things that I think are really cool:

1\. Nice Javascript way of navigating through "pages" that doesn't
require reloading. Excellent.  
2. The text always goes to the bottom of my browser, and the
advertisement is always off the bottom. Try resizing your browser
vertically, and notice how the "Prev Page" and "Next Page" move around
and the text re-flows into more or less pages, depending on how big your
window is. Really cool.  
3. Three column text layout. Great for readability.  
4. Clicking directly on the 3rd column of text is the same as "Next
Page". Nice. (Note how button highlights to let the user know thats how
its going to work). Similarly, clicking on the 1st column goes to the
previous page.

I'm really impressed -- I think someone actually took some time and
thought about this problem, and didn't just cut-and-paste the contents
of their news into a simple browser window. The odd thing is that every
article on the site doesn't format this way, and I don't understand why
not. Take
[this](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/25/business/assess.php) for
example, which uses the traditional "giant scrolling window" method. Too
bad.

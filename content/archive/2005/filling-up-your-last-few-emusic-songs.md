If you're an emusic subscriber, and you're like me, you get some number
of songs for downloading each moth. But, as you can imagine, after
downloading a bunch of albums that have come out in the last month,
you're left with 2 or 3 extra song downloads that you don't know what to
do with. You could download some singles, but if you're like me, you
prefer full albums, and there's never an album with just 2 or 3 songs on
it, is there?

Well, there is. While browsing through the "most popular" lists, I came
across a set of albums called things like "Midnight Rainshower" and
"Waterfall". Furthur digging revealed that these are "soundscape"
albums, with just one continuous, 60-minute track of a waterfall, or a
rain storm. I'm not one to be partial to this kind of stuff, but its a
good way to just use up a remaining one or 2 songs.

Search emusic for "The Atmosphere Collection" and find "[A Week in
Hawaii](http://www.emusic.com/artist/11589/11589694.html)" and "[A Month
in the Brazilian
Rainforest](http://www.emusic.com/artist/11589/11589692.html)" for some
single song, full album downloads.

Ahhh, soothing rainfall.

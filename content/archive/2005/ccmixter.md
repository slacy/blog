I had seen [this site](http://ccmixter.org) a while ago, but forgot to
blog about it.

Its basically a site for publishing and sharing mixes (mash-ups) of
content that is licenced under the Creative Commons (cc) licence.

For a quick fix, try downloading everything on their [editors
picks](http://ccmixter.org/picks/stream/all.m3u) page, or subscribing to
the RSS feed there.

Todays music download comes courtesy of [Kitty-Yo
records](http://www.kitty-yo.net/index2.php).  Despite the pink, orange
and blue website, and the "kitty" name that might make you think its
Japanese.  Its not, its a german independent label.  I found it through
some [Maximillian Hecker](http://www.maximilian-hecker.com/) that I had
in my collection from a previous download session, and found out that
kitty-yo is his label, and that there's a [bunch of stuff to
download](http://slacy.com/music/kitty-yo.wget).  I'm not sure what form
most of this stuff takes (i.e. what the heck its like) because I'm just
downloading it now and haven't sampled it yet.  I'll update when I get a
better feel for it.  But, if Maximilian Hecker is any example, this
stuff is melodic, downtempo, sensitive, and pretty cool.  Have fun.

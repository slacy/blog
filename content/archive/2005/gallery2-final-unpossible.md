Well, quicker than I can blink my eye, Gallery 2.0 has been released! I
just went through the upgrade to go from RC1 to 2.0, and it worked just
great. Congrats to the Gallery team!

Unfortunately, the [gallery website](http://gallery.menalto.com) has
been slashdotted and isn't available. But, the [SourceForge
Page](http://sf.net/projects/gallery) is still up, and downloads are
available!

Gallery2 ROX!

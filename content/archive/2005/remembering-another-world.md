I was just reading a post on SlashDot that was a comparison of 3 popular
pieces of blogging software. Thats all irrelevant, because one of the
"example" blogs for WordPress (the software I use) was [Binary
Bonzai](http://binarybonzai.com) which I had never heard of.

BUT! The homepage image was instantly recognizable as a screenshot from
one of my most favorite video games ever: Another World! He's got a
[great writeup about one of the best games ever
produced](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2005/02/25/its-another-world/).
Too bad the sequel was so bad/hard.

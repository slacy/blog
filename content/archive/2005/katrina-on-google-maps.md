Check out the special "Katrina" vew of [New
Orleans](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=new+orleans,+la&ll=29.995158,-90.116054&spn=0.007256,0.009183&t=e&hl=en).
Everything blue is underwater. Take a close look at the highway that
runs east-west through the city. Major portions of it are completely
submerged, and you can see boats driving around. Wow. (via the

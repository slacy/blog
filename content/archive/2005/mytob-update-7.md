Another one fell through the cracks of [clamav](http://clamav.net)
today. I checked the online scanner, and it was not recognized, so I
submitted it. We'll see if I'm the first person or not. It's surely
another MyTob variant.

*Update:*

This file has been classified as MyTob.HG -- I wasn't the person who
found it, so I don't get my 15 kilobytes of fame this time. Just in case
you're counting, that means that there are now 215 different variants of
MyTob.

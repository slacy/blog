Okay, its the mid-summer TV doldrums, and yet this week had the premier
of "[30
Days](http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/30days/main.html)" on
FX. The basic premise of the first show is that [Morgan
Spurlock](http://blogs.indiewire.com/morganspurlock) (the guy from
[Super Size Me](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0390521)) and his fiance
spend 30 days living in Columbus, OH working and living on nothing more
than minimum wage. It does a great job of showing just how hard the
lifestyle is, and he talks quite a bit about living below the poverty
line is. And Morgan and his wife are young, white, well dressed and well
educated. Even then, things are extremely difficult.

I'm fairly certain that future episodes will not be "starring" Morgan,
but I don't think thats too big of a deal. I bet he'll be the narrator,
and he does a great job of speaking directly to us, "the people."

Get a season pass, you won't be disappointed, and hopefully you can
catch a repeat of the first episode.

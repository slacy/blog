I've been meaning to write this post for a while. Basically it says "You
must watch Robot Chicken". Just use your TiVo, search by title, and
record it. Its an easy 15 minutes per week on Cartoon Network.

What's inspired me to write this is last nights TiVo-inspired episode.
Basically, guy sits down and says something like "I love recording my
favority programs, and TiVo, you learn from my preferences and record
even more of my favorite stuff". Then, it devolves into a multi-day TV
watching episode, where the TiVo character comes out of the TV and
climbs around the living room making odd noises at the guy. I can't do
it justice here, and it was really fantastic. I may make some effort to
digitize it, and post it here, but I don't have anywhere near the
required bandwidth to serve something like that.

Anyway, record Robot Chicken.

UPDATE: [pvrblog.com](http://pvrblog.com) has a link to the
[.torrent](http://bt.gnerd.net/btdownload.php?file=Robot_Chicken-Tivo.mpg.torrent)
of this little episode. Great stuff.

I was recently writing a program to solve the old game Boggle, and I had
to search around for a really long time looking for a <span
style="font-style: italic;">really</span> good dictionary file. I found
these:

[Some weird WinEdit dictionary (very
good!)](http://www.winedt.com/dict.html)  
[Another one from
OpenOffice](http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/spell_dic.html)

Its fairly easy to use standard Linux tools to catenate these files
together and generate a unique word list, if you include the standard
Unix /usr/share/dict/words file. Here's what I get:

/usr/share/dict/words: 45427 words  
/usr/share/dict/english: 180285 words

So, its a much better word list, especially for doing all those things
you like to do with grep and perl and things like crossword puzzles,
scrabble, boggle, etc.

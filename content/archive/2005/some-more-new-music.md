Okay, this time from 2 different sources. First, I heard a Beastie Boys
remix show on the radio, and decided to search for the remixer's name,
and found this: [Beastie Boys Remixes](http://beastieboysremixes.com/).
The site is all in flash, so there's no easy way to automatically
download the stuff. But, its fun and interesting and worth it.

Second on the list are all the free tracks that audioscrobbler.com has.
If you go [here](http://www.audioscrobbler.com/downloads) you can see a
list of links to albums that have free tracks. I've compiled all these
links to free tracks [here](http://slacy.com/music/audioscrobbler.wget).
This will get you about 830Mb of new music (about 220 songs). Some is
obviously junk, but other stuff is quite good. Its a mixed bag.

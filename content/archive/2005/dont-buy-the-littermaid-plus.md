Okay, I don't want to rant about how bad this thing is, so just take it
at this: Don't spend your \$100 on the LitterMaid Plus automatic cat
litter box. It works (barely) but is essentially a piece of junk.

Maybe the [Purrforma Plus](http://www.petmate.com/Catalog.plx?ID=1678)
is a better product (at least it looks nice) but I can't bring myself to
spend \$200 on that thing, when I just blew so much on the LitterMaid.
Too bad I didn't know about the Purrforma first.

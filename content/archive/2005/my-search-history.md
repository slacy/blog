The whole 'net is probably talking about this, but Google just launched
"My Search History" that stores every search (and every thing you've
clicked on) for you. All you need is a GMail account (e-mail me if you
want an invitation) or a "google.com account" which you can sign up for
[here](http://https://www.google.com/accounts/).

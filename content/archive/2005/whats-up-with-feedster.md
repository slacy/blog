I've been trying to get indexed by feedster, and it just ain't workin. I
think that they're overwhelmed with traffic, and can't keep up, but I
can't really tell.

If you follow the link to "Tools"
([here](http://feedster.com/tools.php)) and go through that process, you
get to a point where they want to make sure that you're indexed. But,
when you follow the link to go do so
([here](http://feedster.com/add.php)) it just doesn't seem to do
anything.Â  Ugh!

Well, until then, no one will actually read this, so its not that big of
a deal.

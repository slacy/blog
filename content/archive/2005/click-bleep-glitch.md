Most people probably don't associate the words "Click" "Bleep" and
"Glitch" with music, but others know that its one of the up and coming
genres of electronic music. Basically, think of music made from the
elements of 8-bit game systems (Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, etc.) and
then modernized, digitally edited, and turned into something really
beautiful. Best of all, because its just a small niche market, there's
lots of free music floating around on the internet.

For some great examples, check out the following:

[The artist "Pacifica" on the label "Observatory Online". Try the track
"Andy" for a great
example.](http://www.observatoryonline.org/releases/view_release.php?sku=os019)  
[The artist "Mesu Kasumai" on the label
"8bitpeoples".](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography_gfx.php#8BP032)  
[Other liks on legaltorrents.com for Observatory Online, and
8bitpeoples.](http://legaltorrents.com/)  
[tbtmo.com has some harder glitch/click music thats a bit less melodic,
but still fairly fun and funky.](http://tbtmo.com/)

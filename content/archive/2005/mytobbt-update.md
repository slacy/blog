Sort of interesting things have been happening. I've noticed that the
virus e-mails slow down during the day to only 2-4 per hour, and pick up
at night to 10-15 per hour. In the last 24 hours, I've recieved 198
messages containing Worm.MyTob.BT or one of its variants.

Almost all of them are addressed to "gallery -- slacy.com" which is an
e-mail address that got published in a couple places:

1\. The gallery-devel mailing list  
2. The gallery online docs (contributor)

So, its the combination of being in many people's address books (via the
mailing list) and accessible via the web thats the double whammy for
virus e-mails.

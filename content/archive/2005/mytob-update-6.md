MyTob is still going strong, and still mutating quite a bit. I've got a
better graph this time, showing the top 4 viruses over the last 3 weeks.
Here you can see how CW and CL have seemingly been squashed, but they've
been replaced by newer variants that have arisen: DD and GH. The
horizontal axis is unix-seconds, and the vertical axis is average
messages per day I'm receiving at that point in time. Click on the image
to see a bigger/clearer version (I've got to figure out a soltion to
this horizontal formatting issue with WordPress)

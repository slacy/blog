There are a bunch of cool feeds I've found these days that meet my mood:

[LegalTorrents](http://legaltorrents.com/) is a place to get some great
free music download. This is sort of a torrent-blogified version of my
[music](http://slacy.com/music) section.  
[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/) is another
[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/)-esque site.  
[Funfurde](http://funfurde.blogspot.com/) is a great collection of
modern furniture/decoration.Â  Check out the great link/bookmark
collection on the right hand side!

Thats it for now!

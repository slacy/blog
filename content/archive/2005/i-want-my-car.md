I want to buy a new car, but first, someone has to build it. Here's what
it has to do:

1\. Efficient hybrid. I think it should get 30% better mileage than the
[Prius](http://www.toyota.com/prius/), say 65mpg highway/75mpg city.

2\. "Sporty". I'm thinking something with agressive but "normal" styling.
Not as radical as the [Lotus Elise](http://www.lotuscars.com/). Maybe
something like the [Pontiac Solstice](http://www.pontiac.com/solstice/)
but that doesn't look like ass. If it looked like the [Porsche
Cayman](http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/cayman/) or the Carerra GT,
that would be great. Maybe Porsche should make this thing. (Can anyone
say "Boxster H"?).

3\. Small and Light. Its gotta be easy to park, low to the ground (for
aerodynamics and looks), short wheelbase for quick turning. Its got to
feel "high tech" with an aluminum frame (Lotus style) and doesn't need
"luxury". It should be small. Think Mazda Miata level of interior size
and comfort, or even less. It doesn't have to be the svelt 2000 pounds
that the lotus is, but it also can't be the 3700 pounds that my current
car is. Batteries are going to be the big issue here. Not sure how to
keep them light enough.

4\. Fast. If its small and light, it should be quick off the line. I'd
like to see a peak combined (electric & gas) output of 200+ horsepower,
\~150 foot pounds of torque. I'd also like to see a large electric motor
bias -- something like 70% electric 30% gas. I want it to basically run
like an electric car most of the time. Should have sub 6-second 0-60
time, at least. I'm not too concerned about quarter mile and 60-100
speeds. I know it won't do well on those numbers.

5\. Range. It doesn't need a huge cruising range. 250 miles would be
fine. I'm thinking a 4 gallon gas tank, or something about that size.

6\. Major brand. Its gotta be made by Honda, Mazda, Nissan, etc. I'm not
going to buy a
[tzero](http://www.acpropulsion.com/tzero_pages/tzero_home.htm) or even
something like the Lotus.

7\. Not outrageously priced. It needs to come in squarely at \$30k, and
it doesn't have to have a lot of options to add on. I want it to come
nicely equipped out of the box, with a few cute add-ons, like custom
paint colors, and nice wheels.

8\. Don't design for the people who aren't going to buy it. It doesn't
need to have great winter amenities, it doesn't need a spare tire, it
doesn't need cargo space. Design for California and Florida, sell to
everyone who's willing to buy it.

The other way to describe it would be like this:

- A Honda delSol with less weight, a hybrid motor, and updated styling.  
- A Lotus Elise with a hybrid motor, less radical styling, and cheaper.  
- A Mazda Miata with a hybrid motor, and more agressive styling.  
- A Pontiac Solstice that isn't made by Pontiac, doesn't have a frontend
that looks like ass, is faster, lighter, and is a hybrid.  
- A Porsche Boxter with a hybrid motor, less luxury, less weight, less
cost.  
- A [tzero](http://www.acpropulsion.com/tzero_pages/tzero_home.htm) with
a hybrid motor, and better styling, made by a major manufacturer.  
- An MR2 with a slightly beefier version of the Prius engine.  
- An RX-8 with a hybrid motor, less weird styling, slightly smaller.

Would you buy one?

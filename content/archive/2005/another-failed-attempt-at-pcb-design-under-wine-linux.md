So, I tried to get another PCB design software program to run under
Linux and Wine today. This time it was from pcb123.com, and looks like a
pretty excellent program. I had to modify my wine configuration to make
it think that the Windows version was win2k or better, and the installer
ran, but when the dialog came up, the whole thing was sort of
non-interactive. I could click around, but note of my clicking led to
the next dialog, and therefore I couldn't actually install the program.

This is a real bummer, especially after the failure of ExpressPCB to
install under Wine as well. I've submitted bugs to winehq.org about both
issues, so we'll see if we get any movement on these. I sure hope so,
because I don't want to have to boot up my Winblows box just to do some
PCB design. That would suck. Linux should be able to do this.

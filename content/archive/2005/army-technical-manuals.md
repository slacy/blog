Okay, this is pretty cool. There's a website where you can download
military technical manuals. So, just go to the [ETM
website](https://www.logsa.army.mil/etms/find_etm.cfm), and search for
something like "Apache" under "Pub Title Text" if you'le looking for the
Apache AH-64A operator's manual. This seems very very wrong to me, but
hey, its on the internet, right?  Oh, and you can search for all kinds
of stuff.  Try "M1A1".

Note: It does look like they're trying to put some stuff behind a login
page, but I was just able to download the M1A1 operators manual, even
though the website tried to redirect me to a login page.  e-mail if you
want a copy.  Its well over 1000 pages long, military-style.

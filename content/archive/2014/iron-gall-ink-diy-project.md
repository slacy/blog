This weekend we finished up our "Make your own [Iron Gall
Ink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_gall_ink)" project with the kids.
 Amazingly, our crazy "only using stuff we have at home" experiment
worked and we got something that resembled ink!  We even made our own
rudimentary pens to write with!

To make your own homemade ink, you will need:

-   An Oak Gall.  We got ours from the oak trees near the entrance to
    Bayshore Park along Terminal Blvd. (North end of San Antonio Ave in
    Palo Alto).  There were tons of galls on the ground there under the
    Oak trees.
-   A steel wool pad.  We used an S.O.S pad that I rinsed free of all
    its soap.
-   White vinegar.
-   Corn starch (thickener)
-   Some bamboo barbequeue skewers, the big kind.  We made these into
    our pens.  We tried to find some crow feathers but failed to find
    any that day.
-   A metal strainer, a jar and a couple of small glasses.

Instructions:

1.  Put the steel wool in the jar, and cover it with white vinegar.  Let
    it sit for about 2-3 days until it's completely dissolved and you
    have a dark brown-ish liquid with some remaining flecks of iron.
    (Note: upon further reading, I'm not sure if this is a reasonable
    substitute for FeSO4 but I'm continuing anyway because that's what
    we did...)
2.  Smash up the Gall in a zip lock bag using a hammer.  Smash it really
    good -- to completely powderize the inside parts of it.  Remove the
    largest remaining pieces of "shell" by hand, and keep the rest of
    the powder.
3.  Heat some water in a small glass as you would for making a nice cup
    of tea.
4.  Pour the gall powder into the glass of hot water and stir.  Let it
    steep for a minute or two.  The liquid should be dark brown, almost
    the color of the Iron & Vinegar.
5.  Using the metal strainer, strain out all the pieces of gall from the
    liquid, leaving just the brown liquid.
6.  Put about 2-3 tpsp of the gall liquid into a new glass or
    shallow bowl.
7.  Using a straw or dropper, add a little bit of the Iron &
    Vinegar solution.  The liquid should immediately turn
    dark black/purple.  I think we ended up at about 50/50 but it seemed
    like it would take a lot less Iron -- some recipes seem to say about
    1/3rd of the amount of Tannic Acid. (the brown gall liquid)
8.  If you want, add a bit of corn starch as a thickening agent.

To make a crude pen, take the bamboo skewer, and cut it off at about a
45 degree angle.  Even shallower is better but it tends to split and not
cut nicely at very shallow angles.  Snip off the very tip to leave a
somewhat flat-ish part about 2mm wide at the tip.

Now, dip the pen in the ink and draw!  The ink will come out a dark
purple color, and when it dries, it lightens up a little and comes out a
very nice looking light to deep brown color.

Notes:

I had considered using a bit of dissolved tapioca as a thickening agent
(a substitute for the originally called for Gum Arabic), and I think it
might have worked better than the corn starch, as the ink tended to
flake off somewhat when tried (if very thick).  I think this would
require boiling to dissolve some tapioca in water, then adding that to
the ink.  I was hoping for something "more sticky" than the starch, but
something that we still easily had on hand in the kitchen.

Here's a [great website on Iron Gall
Ink](http://irongallink.org/igi_indexd7ce.html) with several
recipes/formulas but most call for "real" Ferrous Sulfate which I didn't
want to have to procure.

I'm [not actually sure if Steel Wool + Vinegar is actually Ferrous
Sulfate](http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Fun_with_VinegarandIron_Dye_Stains.html)
or is it some other compound? Maybe it was actually Ferrous Acetate?
 Maybe I should have tried to evaporate it a bit more to see if I got
the blue-green crystals through precipitation as the vinegar evaporated?

Having a nice fountain pen, or even maybe a real feather as a writing
instrument might have made the drawing part a lot more fun.  The bamboo
doesn't hold much ink and only lasts for about one letter when writing,
so there's a lot of dipping in ink.  We tried paint brushes but it's not
the same writing feel as something more stiff.

We tried making pens out of drinking straws, but they were far too
flexible to hold up under writing pressure.

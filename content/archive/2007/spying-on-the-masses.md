So, I got this [Eye-Fi](http://eye.fi) card from work, and it works
okay. The interesting thing is that when it posts photos to the
internet, it adds the tag "Eye-Fi" to all the photos. That means you can
search on flickr, smugmug, photobucket, picasaweb, and a variety of
other photo hosting sites to see whats happening **right now**!
Remember, Eye-Fi uploads instantly to the web, so these are the
absolutely newest photos!

The funny thing is, I actually recognized some of the people who took
those photos. Small world! (See you in BV, AVH!)

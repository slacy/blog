In our long and exhausting name searching process, I scraped and
correlated a bunch of data (top 1000 names from 1880's through 2000's)
from the social security website to try and find some "good" names. I
also ran the names through a sound comparison algorithm (aspell
soundslike) to generate a soundprint thats useful for grouping together
names that sound the same. And, I put all the data in a nice .csv file
so you can open it with your favorite spreadsheet program. Here's a
quick description of the columns and why you might want to sort by them:

Column A: "boy" or "girl"  
Column B: The actual name.  
Column C: The length (in characters) of the soundprint. This is roughly
equivalent to the number of syllables of the name, or how long the name
sounds.  
Column D: The soundprint, forward. Sort by this to group together all
names that start with the same sound.  
Column E: The soundprint, backward. Sort by this to group together all
names that \*end\* with the same sound.  
Columns F-R: Name popularity (percent of people with this name) for
decades 1880 through 2000.

There are 5201 names in the list, with 1320 distinct soundprints.

So, I now present you with [The Ultimate Baby Naming
Spreadsheet](http://slacy.com/blog/wp-content/ultimate_names.csv) and

Sound](http://slacy.com/blog/wp-content/sounds.csv). Enjoy!

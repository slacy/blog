ScribeFire is a plugin for Firefox that allows in-browser blogging of
links.  It looks pretty cool, and did a great job of automatically
detecting my WordPress XMLRPC interface.  [Check it
out!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1730)

Powered by [ScribeFire](http://scribefire.com/).

Ok, Update: ScribeFire adds a cheezy "Powered by ScribeFire" text that
you can see above (I'm editing from WordPress now so that it won't
re-add the footer.) This is **really** cheezy, low class, and
crap-tastic. Forget ScribeFire. Don't use it. I'm uninstalling now.
Sad...

This reminds me of old-skool "Shareware" that lets you use it for free
but is really annoying, and asks you to pay for it to get rid of
annoyingness. Thats really not acceptable when WordPress itself is free
and easy to use. I'll just have to find something like this thats
better...

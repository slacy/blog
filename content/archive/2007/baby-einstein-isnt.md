Here's an interesting article titled [DVDs Don't Produce Brainy Babies  
](http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/health/feeds/hscout/2007/08/07/hscout607091.html)
from Forbes that says that showing 'Educational' DVDs to your infant
(aged 8-16 months) doesn't improve their language skills, and in fact,
it could actually slow their language development. Here's my favorite
quote:

> "There are only a fixed number of hours that young babies are awake

I like the term "parentese."

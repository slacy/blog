We recently took a cross-country trip on Virgin America. The flights
were on-time, the crew was nice, the purple lights were trendy and fun,
and the food was great. But, there were a lot of aspects that I was
extremely disappointed with:

1.  Legroom. I'm 6'4", and there wasn't enough legroom. I mean, I was
    totally crushed by the seat in front of me and had no where to go,
    even if fully reclined. I don't really think that 6'4" is *that* far
    above the mean for American males, is it? I haven't been on a plane
    with that little space *ever.* Even the "less legroom" section of
    JetBlue is more comfortable than Virgin America.
2.  Shoulder room entering the plane. There's a plexiglass barrier thats
    not as wide as my shoulders are. I had to squeeze through, carrying
    a backpack and baby in a carseat. Why is this plastic barrier in my
    way?! Let me enter the plane in peace!
3.  Arm rests go up, but not all the way. What is the point of an
    armrest that goes up, if it doesn't get out of your way? It would
    only tilt up to about a 45 degree angle, and thats it. This was
    absolutely no help when getting settled in our seats with 3 carry-on
    bags, a baby, a carseat, 2 winter jackets, and a boppy.
4.  VA Red's TV quality. Even the slightest amount of turbulence, or the
    plane turning, would make the video get all pixelated and break up.
    It would then take 5+ minutes for the signal to return to normal.
    All the while, a DishNetwork dialog box would be onscreen saying
    things like "Now downloading program guide information". Well, screw
    the program guide, since I can't even browse it at all
5.  VA Red's Audio quality. You would think that on a plane thats less
    than 4 months old (VA's first flight was on 8/8/07), that they
    wouldn't have broken 1/8" audio jacks on every single seat. Its
    become the norm for airlines to have broken audio jacks, but I was
    really surprised at this one. Then, when you do actually get the
    audio so that you can hear it, it sounds like crap. Actually, what
    it sounds like is a mono mp3 encoding at about 32kbps. In other
    words, crap. (Why did they bother with such poor encoding and such a
    nice media system?)
6.  VA Red's channel selection. There were several channels that never
    displayed anything other than a DishNetwork dialog box saying
    "You're eligible for a free upgrade. Press Enter now." Um, do I
    care?
7.  VA Red's UI in general. Looks like Linux, unfortunately. Unpolished,
    and way too rough around the edges.
8.  VA Red's mapping interface. Why doesn't the image of the plane
    update in realtime? Seems like the plane moves half way across the
    screen every 5 minutes or so. The inclusion of Google Maps images
    was great, but the lack of updates was horrible.
9.  VA Red's suggestions/feedback system was broken. I got all the way
    to typing in a bunch of comments, only to have the 'submit' button
    fail to work. Ugh.
10. \$8 for a movie! And we have to pay twice if we both want to watch
    it? Seriously, this is going a bit far. \$16 for 2 people to watch a
    movie with crappy audio on an 8" screen is just too much!
11. "This feature is unimplemented." Then why do you have the menu item
    for it? GRRRR! Don't tempt me with reading e-mail and browsing the
    web when its just a pipe dream!

So, a huge thumbs down to VA Red, and a huge thumbs down to legroom, so
a huge thumbs down to Virgin America.

Sorry guys, you're no where even close to being as good as JetBlue.

Problem: You've got a 250G drive sitting around, and you want to use it.
You've already got 1 USB drive attached and adding another seems like a
pain in the butt.

Solution: You go to Fry's and see an empty SAN shell made by Netgear.
You think: "Netgear is a good company, and even though it doesn't say
that its Linux supported on the box, nothing ever does, and its got to
just be a Windows Samba share, right?"

WRONG! The Netgear SC101 runs a proprietary filesystem (Zetera), and
uses a proprietary networking interface. Custom drivers are needed for
any platform that wants to access the data.

Result: You have to go back to Fry's to return the piece of crap that
you bought. Thankfully, you were smart enough to research the situation
before opening it, so the return will be an easy one.

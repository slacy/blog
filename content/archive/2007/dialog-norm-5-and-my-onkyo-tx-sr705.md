I recently noticed something odd from my Onkyo receiver: When the audio
changes (say, from TiVo menus to video playback, or when channel
changing) the front display will sometimes flash something like "Dialog
Norm: -4" or "Dialog Norm: -7" with different values. I figured there
was some setting that I had accidentally set to -4 or -7 when I was
setting the thing up, so I hunted around in the menus for a few minutes
trying to find anything at all that was called "Dialog Norm".

Well, I couldn't find anything! So, I read through the printed manual,
and couldn't find anything, so I downloaded the PDF of the manual, and
searched through it for "dialog" and there were no relevant references.
I was perplexed! So, I searched around on the internet, and didn't find
anything good until I saw some references to "Dialnorm" as a feature of
the AC-3 encoding. That pointed me at the [Wikipedia entry for
Dialnorm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialnorm).

It turns out its something thats a feature of AC-3, and the flashing
display is just to let me know that its 'working' (even though there's
no mention of this in the manual whatsoever). Well, at least I know what
it means now...

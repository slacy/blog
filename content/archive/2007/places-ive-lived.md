One evening, I decided to make placemarks in Google Earth for every
place that I've ever lived. I found it strangely compelling, as I
remembered places, people I knew, and the things I did. Even finding out
where things actually were was sort of fun.

I've published a Google Earth file that you can play along with. [Places
I've Lived.](http://slacy.com/blog/wp-content/steve.kmz) You'll need to
install Google Earth to view the file.

Make sure to turn on "Terrain" and "3D buildings" before loading,
otherwise it won't look quite right. Once you've got it loaded, you can
select the first item and press the "Play" button to go through them in
chronological order. Fun!

Following the launch of [my shared
items](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/12/reader-and-talk-are-friends.html)
on Google Reader, and the fabled [Google
Profiles](http://www.google.com/help/profile/) (which you can edit in
Reader), I've decided to try switching my primary blog reading interface
to Reader.

So, I imported all my feeds, which was a really smooth process, and
things are looking good. Just to see how things work, [I've created some
shared items](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/05279895462821627361)
for you to look at ([or subscribe
to](http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/05279895462821627361/state/com.google/broadcast))
and I think its a pretty cool feature.

Additionally, there's a Reader gadget for my iGoogle homepage, which
gives a nice consolidated blog view. Hopefully, this will all make for a
more efficient blog-reading experience, which means I'll either read
more blogs, or I'll spend less time reading them. Either way, its good,
right?

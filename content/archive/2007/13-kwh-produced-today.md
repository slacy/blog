I know. I'm not supposed to have the system turned on until the PG&E and
city inspections are complete, but I couldn't resist leaving it on for
the day (or for the weekend) to see how much electricity it produced.
Its not quite sunset right now, but its close, and we just broke the
13.0 kWh mark.

Because the solar equinox was just 4 days ago, one may assume that the
average yearly production of the system will be approximately equal to
its production on the equinox times 365. (right?)

And, our average yearly electricity consumption for the previous 24
months was 17 kWh per day.

But, we just replaced all our lightbulbs with compact flourescents, and
we have 2 refrigerators, and I'm tempted to turn the second one off. I
think if I do those two things, we can get our electricity consumption
below 13 kWh/day, and which point we'll have a zero sum electricity
bill.

I'll see what it produces tomorrow. :)

Oh, and yes, I've been thinking of modding a
[WRT54GL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrt54gl), adding a serial port,
hooking it to the [Xantrex
GT3.8](http://www.xantrex.com/web/id/172/p/1/pt/23/product.asp), sending
the results over the network to my desktop, and running
[rrdtool](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) there to generate stats and
graphs of production. I love stats!

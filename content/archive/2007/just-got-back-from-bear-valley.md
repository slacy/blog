Back from Bear Valley and Hawaii, and I'm pouring over gobs of GPS data
and trying to figure out how to do something interesting with them.
Probably at least a few more days of development until you'll be able to
see anything here...

In the mean time, I've installed the WordPress plugin "ditu" which lets
me set placemarks for posts, which seems pretty cool. Kind of a pain in
the ass to use, though.

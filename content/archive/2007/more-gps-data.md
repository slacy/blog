This time, its a short trip [Outrigger paddling outside of the Outrigger
Canoe Club](http://slacy.com/blog/wp-content/20061226.kml) in Honolulu,
on the day after Christmas. Again, you'll need [Google
Earth](http://earth.google.com) to view this file.

You can even see how we circled around a bit giving the kids a ride...
Linked & correlated photos to follow someday...

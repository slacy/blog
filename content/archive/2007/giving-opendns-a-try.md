After chatting with friends over lunch about
[OpenDNS](http://opendns.com), I've decided to give it a try. What I'm
mostly interested in is the anti-phishing and typo correction services,
which seem pretty cool. It went pretty smoothly, although they didn't
have any instructions about how to update my OpenWRT router to OpenDNS.
(thats no surprise!). The secret missing link was that I needed to
reboot the router for the new DNS settings to take effect. Once I did
that, things are up and running well.

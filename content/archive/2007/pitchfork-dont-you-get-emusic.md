I've added [Pitchfork](http://pitchforkmedia.com) music
[reviews](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/record_reviews) to my
[iGoogle](http://google.com/ig) page as a fairly reliable way to find
out about good, new music. Amazingly, each of their reviews has a
"Download from eMusic" link, which I was sooooooo happy to see....until
I clicked on it. It doesn't link directly to the album page! In fact, it
just links to a search result for the artist name, so its possible that
the artist being reviewed isn't on eMusic at all! Its even more likely
that the artist exists, but the new album isn't there yet. Ugh! Its so
frustrating to read a review and not be able to do anything about it!
Pitchfork should be smart enough to only show that link when eMusic
actually has the album. Or, eMusic should show "coming soon" albums that
I can add to my "Save for later" list and check back on! Either would be
better than what we've got now...

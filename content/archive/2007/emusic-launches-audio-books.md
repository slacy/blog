It looks like [emusic](http://emusic.com) has launched an [audio books
subscription plan](http://emusic.com/audiobooks/index.html). As far as I
can tell:

1\. Its a totally separate subscription from their music subscription. I
think I would have preferred if books were "15 songs" and I could use my
music subscription to buy books as well. Having a separate subscription
for books seems wasteful, since I'm probably not going to listen to
audio books on a monthly basis, but it would be interesting to do a
"one-off" download for road trips, etc.

2\. They're still DRM-free mp3 files (hooray!)

3\. It costs \$9.99/mo for "1 credit" which is usually 1 book, but some
books are 2 credits. This feels expensive to me, but I know audio books
are pricey at Borders, so maybe this is reasonable. I presume there are
other subscriptions for more credits per month at less than \$9.99 per
credit.

4\. Books are split into many mp3 files for easy indexing.

The selection looks like mostly "classics", and a little bit of
contemporary essays and memoirs. In general, it doesn't look like the
selection is that impressive...

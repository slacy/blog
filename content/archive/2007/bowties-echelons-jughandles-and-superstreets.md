Do you know what those terms are? After reading [an interesting article
in the SF Chronicle about driving
directions](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/03/04/MTGFUOEHI11.DTL),
they pointed me at [an awesome site showing diagrams of "Unconventional
Intersections"](http://attap.umd.edu/UAID.php?UAIDType=3&Submit=Submit&iFeature=1).
Don't forget to use the dropdown to show all the different types!

With phasing like this:

> One approach on both the arterial and intersecting cross-street are
> elevated on structure as they intersect, while the other approach
> halves intersect at-grade. The result is a symmetrical but offset pair
> of two-phase intersections separated by grade, both operated by
> two-phase signals as in the meeting of two one-way streets.

What's not to love?

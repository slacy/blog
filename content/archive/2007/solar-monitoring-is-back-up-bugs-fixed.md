I'd been struggling to find time to debug the problems I've been having
with my solar monitoring system. Well, after filling up my hard drive
with 60+GB of logs, I finally have deployed a fix to production, and the
new service is running 24/7. (thats a bit of work-speak for everybody)
It'll take another week for the system to collect a nice set of 7-day
logs, but thats to be expected. I may dork around with it a bit more and
try to fill in some of the gaps, for which I actually have logs sitting
in a super secret location.

Oh, and as of yesterday, I'm net -17kWh for the last month. That means
that I've produced more energy than I've used, by just over 1 day's
usage.

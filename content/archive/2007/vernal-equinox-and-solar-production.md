Title: Vernal Equinox and solar production.

So, in my last post, I postulated that the average solar production for
the year was equal to the production on the equinox. After pondering
this for a while, I realized something else. The issue is the angle of
the sun. The panels are oriented to be about perpendicular to the summer
sun at noon, to maximize energy production. What this means is that an
hour of sun in the summer at noon will produce more energy than an hour
of sun in the winter at noon. (All weather effects aside). Thus, 4 hours
of winter sun are less productive than 4 hours of summer sun.

Thats all well and good, but the question now remains: Is the energy
produced by 1 hour of noon sun on the equinox exactly half way between
the summer (solstice) and winter (solstice) production? I think the
answer is that its not. The factor is panel "tilt" (relative to the sun)
and this is a non-linear function, and I'll guess that summer sun is a
**lot** more productive than winter sun.

We'll just have to wait and see, I guess.

I know you're tired of waiting for new pictures of the kid, right? Well,
everyone on our team at wark got an [Eye-Fi](http://eye.fi) card, so now
when we're home and we use the 'small' camera, the pictures go straight
to the web in a flash! All you've got to do is keep a watch on [my
picasaweb](http://picasaweb.google.com/smlacy) account, and you'll see
the latest pictures as they arrive. Here's one from earlier today:

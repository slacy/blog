I always assumed this was a joke, but this makes me think that its a
very real thing.

[The Green Flash.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_flash)

As a kid, I was always told to stare at the setting sun so that I could
catch a green flash. I never saw one, and as an adult, I began to assume
that it was kind of a joke -- if you stare at the sun long enough,
you'll see a "green flash" when you blink, due to the afterimage. But, I
guess there is such a thing as a true Green Flash, and its an
atmospheric phenomenon like a mirage...

Okay, so I decided that [Scribefire](http://scribefire.com) is a good
idea.  Such a good idea that I decided to download the code and grep
around for the snippet that added the "Powered by Scribefire" link at
the bottom of each post, to see if I could remove it.  Scribefire is
GPL'd, so I could release my own version of it without this option.

Lo and behold!  The code says something like "if
(performancing.settings.insertpoweredbypff)" so all I needed to do was
find where to set this setting, and I could turn it off!  Hooray! 

Well, "Hooray!" turns into insane frustration as I search around for the
setting.  Not under "Publishing Options", and not under the preferences
button of the Addon.  Hmm,  where else could it be?

Other people were complaining about this same thing in the Scribefire
support forums, so I looked there, and found the following description
of how to turn the option off:

> In ScribeFire, click the double arrow on the far upper left, click the
> “Settings” button, make sure that you’re on the “:General” tab, scroll
> down to “Automatically insert ‘Powered by ScribeFire’” and make sure
> that it is unchecked.

How obvious is that?  There's a small double arrow in the upper left
that hides the prefernences?  Ugh.  Anyway, so its off now, and I'm
posting from it now, so it can't be all bad, can it?

Scribefire developers:  This option should be disabled by default, or
removed completely.  No one wants this kind of link text at the bottom
of every post.  Seriously.

Title: TiVo's Swivel Search: Am I missing something?

So, I had my first chance to play with a TiVo HD over the holiday
weekend, and I'll say, it was a pretty nice box. I'm especially fond of
the HD loopsets! Nice work, guys.

One feature that I was very anxious to try out was the new "Swivel
Search".

First, I was a bit perplexed by the long "startup" time. None of the
searches under PPTR (is it still called that?) have a startup time, but
this one does. And its kinda long. Yuk.

Then, as I started to type on the virtual keyboard, I noticed that it
had significantly worse response time than the regular PPTR name search
boxes. I think I know why, and I think its because this TiVo HD isn't in
the contiguous 48 states. HME had a pretty bad lag time from Honolulu,
so searching was more difficult than it should have been.

I was hoping for a Google-esque search box for TV listings. Something
where I could type "Simpsons" and see a list of all ump-teen seasons and
episodes with titles, descriptions, season identifiers and episode
numbers for all of them. Unfortunately, it doesn't do this. It still
seems to only show "available" shows (next 2 weeks of PGD plus Amazon
Unbox and friends). Why not let me see \*everything\*? Thats what I
really want!

I was hoping for a search box where I could type "Steve Martin" (or just
"Martin") and see a list of all my favorite movies. (without having to
go through the process of creating a WishList.) Unfornutately, this
didn't work either. The search seems to be a title-only search. Huh? The
weird part was that I could search for "The Jerk" and see Steve Martin,
and navigate there to see all his upcoming movies. So, the functionality
is there, they just didn't expose it in the search box. I found this
especially disappointing.

I tried searching for things that it might have classified as "Tags" (a
very vague concept, at the least), and couldn't see that it was doing
anything more than simple title searching.

I thought it would be cool to search some of the other data in the PGD,
so I searched for "1998" to see if I could see all shows from that year.
No results. How odd.

Then, I tried to figure out what the "Swivel" part of SwivelSearch
refers to. Here's a definition of 'Swivel':

> 1\. a fastening device that allows the thing fastened to turn around
> freely upon it, esp. to turn in a full circle.  
> 2. such a device consisting of two parts, each of which turns around
> independently, as a compound link of a chain, one part of which turns
> freely in the other by means of a headed pin or the like.  
> 3. a pivoted support allowing a gun to turn around in a horizontal
> plane.  
> 4. a swivel gun.  
> 5. a device attached to a loom and used as a shuttle to weave extra
> threads in the production of small figures, esp. dots.  
> 6. to turn or pivot on or as if on a swivel: He swiveled his chair
> around.  
> 7. to fasten by a swivel; furnish with a swivel.  
> 8. to turn on or if as on a swivel.

So, exactly what are we swiveling on?

Is Swivel Search just like Find By Name, except that it searches Unbox
content? It seems less powerful than a reguar keyword-based wishlist
search, which isn't saying much since the WishList search runs directly
on the TiVo, and the SwivelSearch runs on a big server in the sky, so it
should be a lot more powerful, right?

For the long startup time and slow key response, and virtually no added
benefit, I just don't get it. Am I missing something?

P.S.: I presume the term "swivel" is a synonym for "pivot" and refers to
the spreadsheet functionality of "pivot tables." Unfortunately, its
\*not\* anything as powerful or useful as a pivot table. Oh well.

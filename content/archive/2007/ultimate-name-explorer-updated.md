I've added a new row of information to the [Ultimate Name
Explorer](http://slacy.com/names). The row has "Different Ending Sound",
"Different Middle Sound", and "Different Beginning Sound" names. Let me
know what you think!

Here are some links to chew on:

[Stephen](http://slacy.com/names/index.php?name=Stephen&type=male&n=14)  
  
[Andrea](http://slacy.com/names/index.php?name=Andrea&type=female&n=14)  
  
[Vlad](http://slacy.com/names/index.php?name=Vlad&type=all&n=14)

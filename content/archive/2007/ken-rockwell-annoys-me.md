Title: Why Your Camera Does Matter

When I was searching around for info about buying a new camera, I came
across [Ken Rockwell](http://kenrockwell.com)'s website, that has a lot
of useful looking articles about photography.  I read a few of them and
took them with a grain of salt, and the whole thing basically slipped my
mind.

At work today, a photography mailing list mentioned his website as a
reference for camera reviews, and now that I have my camera, I took a
second look at the site, and particularly the article that I had
previously read titled "[Why Your Camera Does Not
Matter](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/notcamera.htm)".

I think I'm in an interesting place to comment on the article, because I
just switched from a compact (Canon SD550) to an entry level DSLR (Canon
Rebel XTi) with a nice lens (Canon 50mm f1.8).  I shoot the same people,
in the same places, in the same conditions, and in the same way. 
Essentially, I'm using the DSLR for "snapshots".  So, the only
difference between what I do now and what I did before is the camera. 
You know what?  The difference between the compact digicam and the DSLR
is absolutely huge. Here's the rundown:

1.  Low light performance.  The SD550 just doesn't have a "fast" enough
    lens to capture low light situations.  Indoor nighttime shots with
    the SD550 required either a very steady hand (and even that didn't
    quite work) or using the flash, which produces that awful "snapshot"
    look.   Even without the big lens, the XTi at ISO1600 has about the
    same amount of noise as the SD550 at ISO400.  Thats 4 times as much
    light with equivalent noise levels.
2.  Contrast and exposure.  The SD550 was continually under or over
    exposing critical areas.  The XTi has much more accurate metering,
    and thus, it does a much better job at making shots look subtle and
    well exposed.
3.  Shutter lag.  This is the most intangible, yet easiest to "feel"
    difference between the two.  The XTi is instant, and the SD550 takes
    a half second or so. How that difference impacts the photos is even
    more amazing.  Try capturing a newborn's first smile with a compact
    digicam that has nearly a second of lag.  The DSLR is a huge winner
    here.  The photos I have just wouldn't be possible with the
    SD550, unfortunately.
4.  Speed of shooting.  The XTi's continuous shooting mode is easily 2
    or 3 times faster than the SD550's same mode.  This means better
    shots of things that didn't last that long.  Again, absolutely
    necessary for good photos of kids.
5.  "Purple fringe".  The nice lens of the XTi has none.  The SD550
    shows purple fringe for most high contrast outdoor shots. This
    always annoyed me about the SD550, and I'm glad I don't have to deal
    with it anymore.
6.  Photo aspect ratio.  The XTi takes "35mm size" photos that really
    look more like "photograhs" than the 4:3 aspect ratio shots from the
    SD550.  The drawback of the XTi is that the 4:3 aspect is actually
    useful for desktop images, and things like that.
7.  Battery life.  Maybe its because the XTi is new, but the battery
    seems to last much longer than the SD550.  I also think its because
    the XTi uses the rear LCD less.
8.  Closeups and zoom.  The 50mm fixed focal distance lens on the XTi
    can take great "close up" shots from across the room or just across
    a table.  I find that it makes the shots a lot more personal than
    "full body" pictures.  With the SD550, you really lose a lot of
    light when you zoom in, making low light colse ups even harder.
9.  Removable lenses.  Of course, with any DSLR, you can replace the
    lenses.  If I find my 50mm to constraining, I can always switch back
    to the default 18-55mm lens and use that.  Or, if I want something
    extra wide, or something extra long, I can choose to purchase those
    lenses.  (This is really a minor point, and I don't expect to buy
    any more lenses for the XTi)

And here's where the SD550 has a slight advantage for my shooting style:

1.  Composing shots using the rear LCD is actually easier than the XTi's
    viewfinder.  I'm still not used to the DSLR style viewfinder, so I'm
    not as good at composing shots well.  The photos always seem to have
    more than what I saw, which is weird.
2.  Review & playback on the SD550 is better.  Its just easier to use
    than the XTi.  The small form factor is better for passing photos
    around a table and sharing with friends.
3.  Movie mode.  The XTi (as with all DSLRs) has no movie mode.  Movies
    are still really useful, especially for kids.
4.  Size.  The SD550 fits in your pocket, and this can't be beat.  (But,
    there's no point in carrying around a camera that can't capture the
    photos you want.  See above points.)
5.  Zoom.  I'm using a small fixed focal length lens on the XTi.  Its
    somewhat limiting, especially when you want to take group shots. 
    Its sometimes hard to fit more than 2 or 3 people in one photo,
    especially indoors where its difficult to get far enough away. 
6.  "Take my photo please" is better on the SD550.  People are afraid of
    DSLR's and generally won't take a good photo of you.  The compact
    camera with the LCD on the back is much better for getting someone
    else to take your picture.

I'm tempted to use the two cameras and take some comparative shots
similar to Ken's website, and post a similar "why Your Camera Does
Matter" page.  (maybe someone has already done this?)

Title: What a "Solar" electricity bill looks like

One of the biggest questions I had before getting my solar system was:
"What's my monthly bill going to look like?" Well, my "bill" is the
same, but I also get a Net Energy Metering Electricity Statement that
has some interesting numbers on it. I end up paying about \$8/month for
distribution fees and taxes, and since its summer, have been building up
an electricity credit for the winter months. I now have \$183 dollars
(414 kWh @ \$0.442 per kWh) of credit built up. I suspect that my yearly
production is going to far exceed my usage, and I'll forefit the extra
credit, but know that I've saved the environment. :) Click on the links
below to see a scan of the actual bill.

On the 2nd page, you can see the month by month, peak ("Summer on") and
off-peak ("Summer off") usage numbers. Look how my peak numbers are
negative (producing more than I'm using) and my off-peak numbers are
positive (using more than I'm producing), since I don't produce anything
at night. :)

You can also compare these numbers with my [Solar Stats
Pages](http://slacy.com/solar) to see what our energy production (and
thus, total energy consumption) were.

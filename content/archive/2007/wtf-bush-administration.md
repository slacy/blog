Here are two quotes from today's news

And then...

So, in other words, Bush says both 'yes' and 'no' to improving emissions
of vehicles.

Yes, I know there's some subtlety here in the Federal vs. State
emissions standards, but with such broad support from the House &
Senate, why does the EPA feel the need to clamp down on even tighter
emissions regulations? I really think that California should ignore the
federal government in this case and just implement their own laws and
standards. Thats what autonomy is about, right?

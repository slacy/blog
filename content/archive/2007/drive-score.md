So, I previously posted about the [WalkScore](http://walkscore.com)
website that gives a rating for how 'walkable' a location is. I thought
it was a fun and interesting idea, and I like to think that being able
to walk places from home is really great.

Today, a commenter on [that
post](http://slacy.com/blog/index.php/2007/08/16/walk-score/) mentioned
that there's now a "[Drive Score](http://drivescore.fizber.com/)"
website. It rates how "driveable" a location is. And, even better, it
doesn't seem like its just a joke.

NOTE: As of 12:30pm PST on 12/3/07, Drive score seems to be down. Their
site says:

> Sorry, Google is blocking requests from Drive Score because we are
> receiving too much traffic right now. We're working with Google to
> resolve this issue. Please try back in one hour. Thanks for using
> Drive Score!

So, you may want to try their site later...

Am I the only one that thinks this is a ridiculous idea? I mean, isn't
everywhere drivable? BTW, we got a 76 out of 100, and the results look
pretty silly. For example, it says that our nearest CVS is 34 miles
away. I don't dispute that, but we've got a Long's Drugs that I think is
under 1 mile away. Why CVS? Oh, and for "Railway Station" it says
"Central Park Apartments" (we also live within walking distance of the
Mountain View Caltrain station). For Home Depot it says "Verity Inc."
Maybe this site isn't even worth mentioning here? Results are so bad as
to be comical.

Anyway, its just something fun to pass the time, I guess.

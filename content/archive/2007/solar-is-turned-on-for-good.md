PG&E came out and installed and inspected my
[NEM](http://www.pge.com/suppliers_purchasing/new_generator/solar_wind_generators/standard_e_net/index.html#topic15)
(Net Metering) system today. This means that I can (and have!) turn on
my solar system for good!

The NEM
[E7](http://www.pge.com/suppliers_purchasing/new_generator/solar_wind_generators/standard_e_net/e7rate.html)
meter records total usage as well as "peak" usage in kWh. PG&E has
approved only 5000 of these E7 style meters for the whole year of 2007!
(see link) They then calculate [peak & off peak usage (or
generation)](http://search.pge.com/cs.html?url=http%3A//www.pge.com/tariffs/pdf/E-7.pdf&qt=E-7+rate+schedule&col=&n=6)
and total them up in a monthly bill. Credits can carryover to the next
month, and we'll only receive a traditional "bill" for electricity once
a year! The meters start out reading 50000 kWh used, so that they won't
go negative when you start to generate electricity. I'll report back
after a day or so of production and see what they look like...

Oh, and the other cool thing about the meter is that its digital and
reads out the instantaneous whole house usage. This means I can see how
much electricity the TV, refrigerator, dryer, etc. are all using, and
I'll be able to compare the day & night numbers too. Right now, the
solar is on, and it was reading about -1.5kW. (yeah, thats negative) and
we were pushing power back into the grid!

In case you missed it, here's the nytimes' ["rent vs. own"
calculator](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/2007_BUYRENT_GRAPHIC.html?_r=4&th&emc=th&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin).
Seems like in the bay area, you have to rely on pretty hefty
appreciation to make owning worth it.

There are some extra "details" tabs on the right hand side that are
really worthwhile filling out. For example, I don't think we spend 0.5%
per year on maintainence, thats for darned sure.

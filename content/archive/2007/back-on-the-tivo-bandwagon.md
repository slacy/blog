Ok, so you probably heard about how we turned off our TiVo about a year
ago, after coming back from an awesome vacation in Montana.

So, now things have changed, and I find myself spending a significant
amount of my time bouncing up and down on a yellow exercise ball in the
living room, (sometimes at 2 or 3 am) and holding a very small person in
my left arm. So, what can you do while bouncing on an exercise ball with
only one hand free?

Well, I'll surely tell you than typing "mplayer
House\_2007\_06\_04\_20:00.avi -vo xv -fs -aspect 1:1" in Dvorak on a
Linux media PC isn't really one of those things.

But, using the awesome TiVo remote, I can turn on the TV, and actually
watch a TV program.

So, we're starting from scratch, keeping things simple (only 10 season
passes so far!) and we've got the old Phoenix up and running again, with
a nice HD antenna on the roof for locals, and a really limited set of
channels on DirecTV. We'll see how it goes, but so far, its going really
well. :)

Ok, so Isaac had a mild case of jaundice that set in on day 3. It was
bad enough that the hospital wanted to send us home with a "billi
blanket" which is a sort of blue light that you wrap around the baby to
break down the jaundice. Thats all well and good, and we want him to be
healthy, but this whole billi blanket thing turned out to be a total
nightmare. Here's the story.

On the day we were scheduled to check out of the hospital, they told us
that his billirubin levels were "borderline" and that they wanted to
send us home with a billi blanket. Great, no problem. But, they said
that the light was actually supplied by a 3rd party rental company, and
that we'd have to wait for it to be delivered. It was about 10am when we
started waiting. (We were due to check out at about 11). We waited and
waited -- in fact, didn't actually leave the hospital until almost 6pm!
And, when the delivery guy arrived, he was completely clueless about how
to use the thing. He didn't deliver it with its "cover" and actually
gave us incorrect instructions on how to use it. All the while, the
hospital staff and he were saying "you need to keep your baby in this 24
hours a day." Are you kidding? We need to keep our 3 day old
breastfeeding baby hooked up to a hard plastic light with a 3/4" plastic
tube hanging out of it all day long? How do we change his diapers? How
to we feed him? How do we keep the thing on? (It had no straps, velcro,
or similar stuff to keep it in place). No one demonstrated what to do.

So, we get home, we eat dinner with friends, and we bring him upstairs
to give it a try. Screaming, screaming, and more hysterical screaming.
Then, the flailing begins and the hours of dilligent swaddling,
shushing, rocking and comforting culminate in the entire thing falling
right off. Just to give you a feel for what this thing was like -- its
about 14" long, 4" wide, and was made out of a stiff plastic that just
wanted to be flat. Oh, and it had a giant 4 foot long tube coming out of
one end. So, we try swaddling him, we try putting it under his clothes
(for about 30 seconds, that is) and we try a few other things and
realize that there must be something we're missing. We hadn't gotten the
fabled "covers" yet (to be delivered the next day) and we had a doctors
appointment in the morning, so we decided to just wait and have the
doctor show us how to use it.

So, morning comes, we head to the Dr.'s office, with the kid & billi
blanket it tow. He tells us we need to be using it 24 hours a day. We
say "please show us how to use it -- this thing is totally impossible to
use." His response? "Its the rental equipment providers job to instruct
you on how to use the device. I've not seen this model before and I
can't help you." ARE YOU SERIOUS? Let it be said that now that the
jaundice is over, we won't be returning to this doctor. We were furious.

So, we get home, and with new resolve and the help of the ["Miracle
Blanket"](http://www.miracleblanket.com/index.htm) we actually get him
all wrapped up and sleeping in the billi blanket. Whew! Do we keep it on
during feedings and his awake time? No way. Its just not realistic, in
fact, just not possible. He screams bloody murder during every waking
moment in that thing, and we weren't going to subject him to that. I'm
not even sure that feeding while that thing was wrapped around him was
possible, he was so hysterical. So, we do the best we can, he sleeps
with the light, and has a blood test the next day. Yay! His billirubin
had gone down!

We spent the next 2 days doing the same thing, wrapping with the Miracle
Blanket and the Billi Blanket at the same time while he sleeps. Other
times, we gave him a break. By Friday (4 days of phototherapy) his
billirubin levels were low enough that the doctor said we didn't need to
use the "blanket" anymore! Hooray for Isaac!

The moral of the story?

Although the design of the ["Wallaby 3" phototherapy blanket by
Respironics](http://wallaby3.respironics.com)sucks, it worked.  
[Apria Healthcare](http://www.apria.com/home/) appears to be full of a
bunch of incompetent morons.  
Our first attempt at picking a Pediatrician failed miserably.  
Isaac is healthy!

P.S. As an engineer, I'd like to leave some feedback for Respironics,
the makers of the Wallaby 3 phototherapy blanket:

1\. Include written instructions with the unit. Detail exactly how to
wrap the baby securely with the light, using several different types,
shapes, and styles of blanket, onesie, etc.  
2. Don't just provide a "tissue paper" cover. You need to manufacture an
entire cloth swaddling blanket that fits around the phototherapy light
and makes it easy to wrap the kid in the light. At least 2 of these
should be included with the unit.  
3. Make a longer cord! The existing cord length (\~4 feet) was barely
enough to reach from the power supply to the baby. I'd say 8 feet long
-- long enough to reach from the power supply to the crib and to a
nearby chair used for breastfeeding.  
4. Make the cord easier to detach & reattach. I know you think its
simple the way it is, but you haven't tried using it at 2:30am when
you're running on 2 hours of sleep.  
5. Do some user testing! Its so clear to me that this is a piece of
"technology" and not a user tested device. Do some user tests, and do
whatever your test subjects tell you.

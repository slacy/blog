One of the interesting questions about having a solar system is how does
the weather affect solar production. Specifically, how does temperature
effect the panel output. If I ever had spare time and money, I'd get one
of these [WMR918](http://www.ambientweather.com/wmorscwiprwe.html)
units, and run [wx200d](http://wx200d.sf.net) to collect the data, and
compare that to the solar output.

Unfortunately, I've had some issues getting data collected right from
the solar system. I actually found the missing data, and may try to
re-insert it today.

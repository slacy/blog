I mentioned the "[Crazy
80's](http://slacy.com/blog/index.php/2005/04/22/todays-music-mash/)"
mix back in 2005, and I wanted to mention it again today because its one
of the few "I found it on the web" music downloads that I keep coming
back to, and actually listen to on a fairly regular basis.

You know that feeling when you're at work and feeling like you need
something to perk you up a bit? Well, Crazy 80's is the solution to that
problem, and it'll give you a dose of Journey at the same time. [Go

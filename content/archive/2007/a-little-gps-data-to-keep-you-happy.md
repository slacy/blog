Yeah, been recording a lot of stuff with the GPS, and I figured people
might be mildly interested in taking a look at it.

I'm still coming up with a good software display solution (using Google
Maps) but until thats done, its easy to export these things into Google
Earth as KML files. So, with no further adieu, I present you... [our
drive from Bear Valley, CA to Mountain View,
CA](http://slacy.com/blog/wp-content/20070102.kml)

(Note: you'll need to install Google Earth from http://earth.google.com
before being able to really view that link. In fact, you may need to
"Save As" and then open the .kml file directly from Earth)

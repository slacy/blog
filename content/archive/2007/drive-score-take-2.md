The [Drive Score](http://drivescore.fizber.com/) website is now back
online, so I can tell you:

1\. Death Valley, CA gets a "7/100" (If you can find someplace thats less
drivable, let me know)  
2. Area 51, NV gets an "8/100"  
2. Pony, Montana gets a "12/100"  
3. New York, NY gets an "83/100" (NB: In real life, do you think New
York is more or less 'drive-able' than Death Valley?)

Thinking about this site more, I now suspect that its just a straight
javascript rip-off of the walkscore site. Lots of these types of
mash-ups are only implemented in Javascript, and thus, are very easy to
rip off and tailor to your own needs. I bet thats whats happened here.

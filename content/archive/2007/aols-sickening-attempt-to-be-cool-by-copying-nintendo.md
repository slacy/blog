I present you with [WeeWorld](http://www.weeworld.com/) by AOL,
described in their marketing e-mail as:

> A WeeMee is a miniature version of you. With just a few clicks, you
> can create your own WeeMee absolutely free.
>
> There are hundreds of looks to choose from, so you can make your
> WeeMee as unique as you are! But the fun doesn't stop there -- once
> you've created your WeeMee, visit WeeWorld, where you can play games,
> send ecards and create email signatures to show your individuality
> everywhere you go online.

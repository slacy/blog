After the troubles with Netjuke after my upgrade to FC6, I decided to
start looking around for a replacement for it. In my searching, I came
across [ampache](http://ampache.org), which offers basically everything
Netjuke did, and more. Here's a short version of all the great things:

-   A 'search' that searches everything (artists, albums, tracks) all at
    the same time
-   Automatic import of album art from amazon, painlessly.
-   The notion of a "Catalog" thats a collection of music.
-   Automatic support for remote Catalogs, with API keys and security!
    Hey guys, if you read this, and install Ampache, I'd be happy to
    share my music collection -- drop me a line. You know who you are.
    :) Oh, and if you want an account to try it out, drop me an e-mail
    and I'll set one up for you.
-   Builtin support for per-track ratings, and suggestions via last.fm.
    Awesome
-   The UI is quite fast.
-   Builtin support for downsampling.
-   Cool community features, like the ability to see the last N tracks
    played (by everyone) as well as what each user is listening to
    right now.

The only downside is that I had to increase my PHP memory limit to
import my music collection, but once I figured that out, it imported all
my music, and works great. Rescanning for new music is painless and
reasonably fast, as well. All it needs now is a color theme that isn't
so bland, and a better logo...

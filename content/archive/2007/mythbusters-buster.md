I've started a new blog to critique and analyze
[Mythbusters](http://discovery.com/mythbusters) episodes. Every time I
watch the show (which I really enjoy) all I think about is how messed up
(or spot-on) some of their analysis is, so I thought I'd put it down in
a blog... Here's a link to
[MythBustersBuster](http://mythbustersbuster.wordpress.com). I'm still
going through the "back catalog" to try to fill things in, and I've got
11 saved episodes on the TiVo, so as soon as I have 11 hours of free
time, I'll post them all. :)

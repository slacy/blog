So, I saw this post on [technocrat](http://technocrat.net) about "[A
Million Penguins](http://amillionpenguins.com)" which is a
self-proclaimed "Wikinovel." So, my first thought was that its a
curiosity. The text seems a bit stilted, simple, disjointed. I'm not
sure. I haven't read the whole thing.

But, being familiar with the MediaWiki software, I decided to check out
the
[Special:RecentChanges](http://www.amillionpenguins.com/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges)
page, which shows all recent edits in reverse chronological order. Wow.
Its awesome. Clicking on each diff and seeing people fix spelling
mistakes, capitalization, subtle small changes to dialogue. Its all
there. Its live and updating right now. Its sort of a bizarry
voyeuristic look into collaborative novel writing. I'm totally
fascinated.

Check it out.

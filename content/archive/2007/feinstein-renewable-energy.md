Today, I filled out the form on
[solar-nation.org](http://capwiz.com/re-action/issues/alert/?alertid=9328091&type=CO).
It sent e-mails for me to [Dianne
Feinstein](http://feinstein.senate.gov), [Anna
Eshoo](http://eshoo.house.gov) and [Barbara
Boxer](http://boxer.senate.gov). Boxer & Eshoo sent generic "thanks for
your feedback" e-mails, but the awesome Dianne Feinstein sent this:

> Mr. Stephen Lacy  
> Mountain View, California 94041

> Dear Mr. Lacy:
>
> Thank you for writing to express your support for  
> the "Securing America's Energy Independence Act of  
> 2007" (S. 590). I appreciate hearing from you on this  
> important topic.
>
> I believe renewable energy sources hold a great  
> deal of potential to reduce air pollution, combat global  
> climate change, increase economic competitiveness and  
> reduce our nation's dependence on oil. As you may  
> know, the Federal government plays an important role in  
> supporting the development of renewable energy sources.  
> S. 590 has been referred to the Senate Committee on  
> Finance, of which I am not a member. Please know that I  
> will keep your comments in mind should this legislation  
> come before the Senate.
>
> You may be interested to know that I am taking an  
> active role in supporting renewable energy legislation.  
> Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and I have to  
> introduced the "EXTEND the Energy Efficiency  
> Incentives Act of 2007," which builds on the incentives  
> for efficient buildings adopted in the Energy Policy Act  
> of 2005. The principal purpose of the bill is to extend  
> temporary tax incentives for energy efficiency buildings  
> so that the business community can make rational  
> investments in complying with the ambitious  
> requirements of the incentives. The "EXTEND Act"  
> establishes solar energy tax incentives and extends other  
> energy efficiency tax credits, such as those for home  
> retrofits that save energy.
>
> I also plan to introduce the "Energy Efficiency  
> Improvement Act of 2007," which would establish a  
> national energy efficiency program modeled after  
> California's energy savings programs. This bill would  
> not only require electricity and natural gas distributors to  
> implement energy efficiency measures, but also mandate  
> strict energy efficiency standards for Federal,  
> commercial, and residential buildings. The revised  
> building codes would save 13 million metric tons of  
> carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 from new homes and  
> buildings, a reduction of 25% below projected levels.
>
> Again, thank you for your letter. I hope your will  
> continue to write to me on issues that are important to  
> you. If you have any additional comments or questions,  
> please feel free to contact my Washington, D.C. office at  
> (202) 224-3841.

> Sincerely yours,

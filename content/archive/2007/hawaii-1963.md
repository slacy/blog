I've embarked on another photo cataloging & restoration project, and
this one is of quite a bit larger scale than my last one, which was a
few hundred slides. At best guess, I think I have several thousand
family photos from the early 1930's through the 1980's. The first step
is to get them into archival quality storage binders (both prints &
negatives) so that I can begin to think about ordering them properly.
Then, I'll scan them all in. I expect this one to be a several month
long project.

There were a few slides hanging around in the bottom of one of the
boxes, so I've scanned those in. They were in 2 boxes that both had
"Sept 27, 1963" stamped on the inside, which I presume to be the date
they were developed. They're mostly pictures of the eastern and
northeastern shore of Hawaii. Click on the image below for a link to the
gallery.

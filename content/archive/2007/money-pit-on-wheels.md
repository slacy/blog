So, I took my car in for service 2 weeks ago because the driver's side
window had fallen off its tracks for the second time (the passenger side
has fallen off twice as well), and while I was there, I had them to a
60k service. Let's just say it was expensive. They mentioned that I
needed a new battery -- I procrastinated for a week or so, and then one
day while driving home from work my radio cut out, and the ABS, Airbag,
and Battery lights came on. Ok, time to get a new battery! So, I went
out last weekend and did that, but the battery light still didn't go
out. I drove for a couple days thinking that maybe the new battery was a
little low and needed to be charged up (by driving). Then, this morning,
I decided to see what was up, and measured the unloaded battery voltage.
12V! For those who don't know -- thats very low. I started the car and
measured the voltage: 11.5V! For car batteries, that means "totally dead
and not being charged by the car". So, I drove to the repair shop, and
they took the car and called with a quote for the repairs. "The parts
are cheap but it'll take us 3 hours of labor". Ugh!

In the last month, I've spent 25% of the [Kelly Blue
Book](http://kbb.com) value of the car on repairs. And thus, its new
name: Money pit on wheels.

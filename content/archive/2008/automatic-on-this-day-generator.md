I had a lot of fun writing the "on this day" post a couple of days ago,
so I spent some time collecting the image capture dates of 27,727 images
in my collection, and whipped up a very crude PHP script to show the
nearest picture to ***right now*** that I have in my collection, from
years past.Â  In other words, the same date & time as it is now, but N
years ago.

Note that some years with only a few photos might show a pretty bizarre
photo, but in general I think the answers are pretty much correct.

Also note that some photos are only available if you're logged in, so if
you see a password box, then you should log in to see the image. (this
prevents web crawlers from killing my server)

Things that would be fun to add:

- Custom dates (not just "now")

- On this "week / month / etc."

- exactly N days ago (i.e. 400 days ago)

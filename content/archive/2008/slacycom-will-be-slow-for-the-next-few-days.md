Hey, I finally got my machine at the colocation facility up and running.

So, now I'm doing an outrageous rsync of all my content (photos, music,
etc.) out to the new server. Since my crappy DSL has only 768kbps uplink
(and I can only get about 685kbps out of it), its going to take a week
or so to copy out all the data.

This means that accessing slacy.com is going to be a little slow. Sorry!

When this is all done, I'm going to start to move everything to the new
blazing-fast server. The big difference? Well, instead of the wimpy
685kbps maximum speed, its more like 15,000kbps (21 times faster). It
should make the gallery a \*lot\* snappier for people with high speed
connections. It should also let me put reasonable videos up on my site
too... More details when I finally get things set up for good.

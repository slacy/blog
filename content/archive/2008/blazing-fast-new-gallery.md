Have a look at the [new server running a copy of the
gallery](http://67.218.97.2/gallery/v/2008/).

If you see any issues, let me know. I know some of the links point back
to kleinlacy.com, so make sure that you're still on the numeric IP
address and you'll be using the new machine.

If you want, you can compare performance between the new server and the
[old server](http://slacy.com/gallery/v/2008). The difference is that
the new one has a 'direct' connection to the internet, and the old one
goes through my home DSL line. Whoopee!

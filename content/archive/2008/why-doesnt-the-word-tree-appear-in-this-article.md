Am I such a product of a 1990's CS program that I still refer to the
datastructure once known as a '[Binary
Tree](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/04/binary_heaps.php)'.

Its like that day when they announced that Brontosaurus never actually
existed, or that Pluto wasn't a planet. Sigh.

NB: Firefox failed me, and the word 'tree' actually does appear in that
article. Sigh, I guess I just suck at CS in general. Heaps and trees are
basically the same thing to my feebleized brain.

So, I've been playing around with the [Fold It!](http://fold.it/portal)
protein folding game, and boy, is it cool. The website (on the previous
link) seems to be completely swamped and not responding, so you may have
some trouble creating an account and downloading the client.

The general premise is to turn protein folding into a game, and let "the
masses" solve hard protein folding problems. Users can share potential
solutions and improve on them, or you can just learn about protein
folding and have some fun.

I think this is a really great example of a "Mechanical Turk"
([here,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk)
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk)) where real people
do a better job of solving a very difficult problem.

The Fold It! client has a nice simple UI and presentation, and ran under
Wine (Windows emulation for Linux) the very first time with virtually no
issues at all. Kudos to the Fold It! team for making such a fun and
educational product!

P.S. : If you're having issues downloading the client, I have a local
copy of it -- just send me an e-mail and I'll send you a copy of the
.exe or provide a link on my nice fast server.

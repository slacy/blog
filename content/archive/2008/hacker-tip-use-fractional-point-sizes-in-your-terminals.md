I just realized last night that with scalable fonts, you can set your
font size to fractional values.  This is great news, because I'm always
torn between 9 point being "too small" and 10 point being "too big". 
So, I can now use 9.5 point Bitstream Vera Sans Mono as my terminal
font, and all is well with the universe.  I think this will also be
really useful for setting up my Netbook with some really nice terminal
fonts that fit the small screen well.  Here are 3 screenshots.

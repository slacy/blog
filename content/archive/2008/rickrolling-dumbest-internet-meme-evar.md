I just want to say that I think the whole "Rickrolling" (search
wikipedia, I'm too lazy to link) is the dumbest internet meme to date.
It makes it look like the entire internet population is 12-year old
boys. Seriously, grow up, get over it. Rick Astley sucked back then, and
he sucks now. This should not be news to you if you were born after
1985, which you probably weren't.

LOLcats, on the other hand, are the pinnacle of intellectual humor and
sophistication. I can haz moar?

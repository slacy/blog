Here are my drink requirements:

1.  No sugar or sweeteners.
2.  Has Caffeine, but not too much.
3.  Natural (i.e. not made of chemicals and synthetic junk.)
4.  Tastes good cold.
5.  Less calories than Coke/Milk/Juick (i.e. much less than
    100 kCal/12oz)

Right now, I'm stuck with Iced Tea, and possibly Iced Coffee, and I'm
getting really bored.   Ideas?

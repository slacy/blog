I'm working on different encodings to share my HD movies to you, my
readers. So, in the spirit of things, I'll give you a small sample.
Click on the link below, and please tell me 2 things:

1\. What did your browser say? Did it offer to open the file with a
specific application? Or, did it just offer to "save to disk". If the
latter, choose to save, and then open with Windows Media Player or
Quicktime.  
2. Did it play? Did it look okay? Could you hear the sound? Did you have
any other problems viewing the movie?

Ok, heres your link:

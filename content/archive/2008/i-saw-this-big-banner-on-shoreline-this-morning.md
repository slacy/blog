For a company called "ooyala". I knew I'd never remember the name when I
got back to my computer, so I kept going "O. O. Y. A. L. A." over and
over in my head so I wouldn't forget it.

When I got to work I went to [ooyala.com](http://ooyala.com) and saw a
bunch of stock footage in "High Def" What resolution? Oh, its not 720p?
And what bitrate? Looks kindo blocky to me. Fullscreen? Wait, now its
like 5FPS? I don't get it.

I mean, its certainly 'slick' but I just get a weird vibe from these
guys...

What I want to do is take a few of
[these](http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail?name=336-1424-5-ND),
hooking up one to each circuit breaker in my electrical panel. Then, I'd
use a microcontroller to do an ADC and digitize the values, and provide
output via USB or Serial, and use an embedded PC to publish the data to
the web.

Ah, I long for the days of free time when such a project could actually
be reality... :)

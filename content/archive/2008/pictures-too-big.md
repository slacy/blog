Just wanted to ask for some feedback about the new, larger pictures I've
been using in blog posts. I really wanted to make it easier to view
things right here on the blog without clicking all the way through to
the gallery, so I hacked the CSS for my WordPress theme to make it a
better showcase for images. I know it looks a bit rough around the
edges, but I think the functionality is better, so its a good
compromise, right?

Let me know what you think!

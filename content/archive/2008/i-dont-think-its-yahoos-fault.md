[Kevin postulated as to whether a recent surge in social networking
invitations in the fault of Yahoo!.](http://fury.com/article/2254.php)
I'll have to say that for me, its 100% "[NotchUp](http://notchup.com)".
Andrea and I were both joking that their "private beta" seems to include
the entire LinkedIn user base. Awesome. (I've gotten 3 invitations thus
far, and I'm not sure if I'm going to respond or not. I'm sort of a
social networking curmudgeon)

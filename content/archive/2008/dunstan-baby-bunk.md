I've never heard about [Dunstan Baby
Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunstan_Baby_Language) before. Is
this total bunk? Seems inconceivable to me that there'd be a special
word for "lower intestinal pain" unless thats just a code word for "I'm
about to take a huge dump that goes all the way up to the back of my
neck". I can imagine that there's a word for that. :)

Oh, and what about all the other random noises? "Nyah nyah nyah nyah
nyah! eeeeeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmmm mmmm mmm mmmmmm!" (thats what he sounds
like).

By the way, we think his first word is "kitty-cat" or pronounced as
'ki-ka' or 'k-t' (just the fricatives in that last example, no vowels)

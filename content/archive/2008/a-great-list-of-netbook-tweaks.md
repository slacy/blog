Although [this page](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne) says
it's specifically for the Acer Aspire One, it actually applies to most
netbooks, since they all use the exact same chipsets.Â  Some of the
wireless & sound stuff might vary per device, but all the other system
tweaks are great ideas, and I'm trying them out now on my Lenovo S10.

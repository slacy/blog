This feels like a perfect analogy to me- - can someone describe why its
\*not\* true?

> "Once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and announced to the
> villagers that he would buy monkeys for \$10 each. The villagers
> seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to the forest and
> started catching them. The man bought thousands at \$10 and, as supply
> started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. He further
> announced that he would now buy monkeys at \$20 each. This renewed the
> efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again.
>
> Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back
> to their farms. The offer increased to \$25 each and the supply of
> monkeys became so scarce it was an effort to even find a monkey, let
> alone catch it! The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at
> \$50 each! However, since he had to go to the city on some business,
> his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.
>
> In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers. "Look at
> all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has already collected.
> I will sell them to you at \$35 and when the man returns from the
> city, you can sell them to him for \$50 each." The villagers rounded
> up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys.
>
> Then they never saw the man nor his assistant again, only lots and
> lots of monkeys! Now you have a better understanding of how the stock
> market works."

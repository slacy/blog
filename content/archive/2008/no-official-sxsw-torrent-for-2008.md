This is very sad news. The blog [SXSW Baby is reporting that there will
be no official SXSW music torrent this
year.](http://www.sxswbaby.com/index.php/site/no_sxsw_music_torrent_this_year/)
Well, thankfully, I've got all the music locally. I'm not sure why they
would put all the files on their server, and not provide a .torrent of
it all. Everyone is just going to download all the songs one by one and
they'll have to pay for the bandwidth themselves.

Like I said before, send me an e-mail if you want a piece of the action.

P.S. I can make a torrent of the daytrotter stuff as well...

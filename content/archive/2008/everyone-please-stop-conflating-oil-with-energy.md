Title: Everyone, please stop conflating oil with energy.

Every day on NPR I hear some news story about how McCain wants to
"increase the energy supply" and that Obama "doesn't think we need more
energy", or some paraphrase of crap like that.

I'm disgusted that we, as a society, continue to fall for these simple
word substitutions.  There's plenty of "energy" in the world, we're just
not doing anything with it.   For example, the american southwest
receives enough solar radiation to power the entire country, but we just
let it bake the sand.

The 3 common types of energy use in the US are:

1.  Fuel (gasoline, diesel, coal, natural gas, etc.) burned in an engine
    (piston, turbine, or any other internal or external combustion), and
    used for motive force (a car, truck, plane, train, etc.).
2.  Fuel burned as a direct source of heat (a water heater, furnace,
    wood or coal burning stove, a gas oven, etc.)
3.  Fuel burned in an engine connected to a magneto, and used to
    produce electricity.
4.  Alternative sources of electricity.  For example: solar, wind,
    hydroelectric, nuclear, etc.

When they say "there's an energy shortage" what they're saying is
"there's a shortage of conventional fuel" or, "fuel supply is lower than
demand, and therefore, prices have risen."  What they neglect to mention
is my point \#4 above:  Energy does not always come from fuel!  We have
become far too focused on conventional means of energy production!

So, every time you hear the word "energy" in the news, you should
substitute it in your head with "fuel", and you should think about how
many people profit when you pump a tank full of light sweet crude into
your car.

When you hear "energy prices are high" you should think "fuel prices are
high" which is a more correct characterization of the situation, and
focuses on the crux of the matter:  Fuel used for transportation of
goods. (Gasoline and Diesel, to be exact).  These are the main commodity
prices that have risen.   Costs for other sources of energy (solar,
wind, etc.) are actually falling.  In other words, alternative good,
conventional bad.

What McCain wants is more oil, and I wish the news agencies (including
NPR) wouldn't fall for his simple substitution language.  I'm just
waiting for the day that McCain says something like "we need to drill
for more energy."  You don't "drill for energy", you drill for oil,
which you then burn to turn into energy, and this is not the only source
of energy.  Get it straight.

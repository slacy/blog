With my last round of eMusic downloads, I tried to pick some new
electronic music that I thought would be pretty bleeding edge hardcore
shit.

It turned out to sound more like 80's synth pop.

I'm happy about the music, but sad that I'm getting so old. I can't even
download edgy electronica anymore.

(BTW, Its [Cut/Copy](http://cut-copy.blogspot.com/) and [Foundry Field
Recordings](http://www.theplugg.com/2007/03/27/the-foundry-field-recordings/))

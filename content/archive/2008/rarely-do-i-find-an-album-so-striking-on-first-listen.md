I'm listening to "Wolves and Wishes" by [Dosh](http://doshfamily.com)
and I'm just awestruck. Each song starts out feeling a bit unpolished,
rough, experimental, or just a bit amateur, but then as the layers are
added and mixed, those rough beginnings are polished into a shiny and
beautiful work. Its got an amazing set of instruments -- I can hear
bells, violins, saxophone, guitar, piano, percussion, all mixed in
together to perfection. Awesome!

Its available on eMusic, or you can ask me for a login and I'll let you
preview it from my personal collection.

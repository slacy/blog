Title: Amazon's mp3 service makes me think eMusic isn't going to last...

I'm downloading more and more stuff from Amazon's MP3 service these
days. The big driver was actually their "deals" twitter feed that can be
found at http://twitter.com/amazonmp3

They advertize daily (and weekend) album deals for between \$2 and \$5
per *album*. If the average album has 12 songs, then this is between 17
and 42 cents per song, which is seeming really reasonable to me, and at
the low end, is cheaper than my current eMusic subscription of 90 songs
for \$20, or 22.2 cents per song.

The best part is that with Amazon's large DRM-free collection, I don't
have to agonize about not being able to find what I'm really looking
for. That convenience alone is worth something, and isn't it worth
paying a little more for music you really want instead of getting cheap
music that you don't want?

(NB: My cast few batches of eMusic have had some really great stuff, so
I'm not really complaining, but I am feeling more and more like I've
exhausted their collection)

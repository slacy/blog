I upgraded my slimserver installation to their newest version: 
SqueezeCenter.  The upgrade went well, except, as usual, took several
hours to rescan my music collection, using 100% of a single core the
entire time.

Slimdevices:  When are you going to fix this?  Other web music players
(i.e. ampache, etc.) can rescan 30k files in just a few minutes.  Why
does it take hours on SqueezeCenter?

On the positive side, this is the first time that I've upgraded and it
hasn't totally hozed my entire music setup.   Woot!

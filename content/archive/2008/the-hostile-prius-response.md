Now that we're Prius owners, I've had the chance to get some
not-so-friendly interjections from people who overhear a conversation
about a prius. This just happened the other day -- I'm not sure even
what we were talking about, but someone sitting nearby interjected with
something that went kind a like this:

> I don't know what the big deal is with the Prius, I had a honda civic
> in the 80's that got 45 miles to the gallon too!

I wasn't in the mood for an argument, but I agree that its a really
interesting point. Even my 1994 Acura Integra would get \~40 mpg on long
highway trips, even at 75mph. So, whats the big deal about the Prius?

Well, here's my list:

1.  It has all the modern safety equipment that your 80's era
    Civic didn't. (Airbags, 5mph bumpers, crumple zones, etc.)
2.  It gets 40+ mpg **city** mileage too, and nearly 50 mpg highway. (I
    bet that Civic got more like 25/37 mpg city/hwy.) The Prius is rated
    45/48 mpg, and that seems pretty accurate.
3.  Its a lot bigger than your 80's vintage Civic (can seat 4
    adults comfortably)
4.  The Prius passes modern-day emissions tests, which the Civic
    likely didn't.
5.  The Prius is supporting a new model for vehicle drivetrains. Take
    its hybrid design and scale up the electric motors, and you end up
    with a true zero-emissions EV. (Yes, this is a bit of a stretch, but
    I do think its the right direction to go in).
6.  Great! You had an efficient car in the 80's after the gas crisis.
    What do you drive today?

Thoughts? Is the Prius any better than an 80's era Civic?

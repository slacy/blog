Hey, I was searching around the other day for a blog targeted at bay
area techie dads, and to my surprise, couldn't find one. (Literally! Not
a single one!) So, I wondered if I should start one, and I wondered if
*you*, yes *YOU!* wanted to contribute.

I figured it would focus on things like

<li>
Being a techie working dad. (How do you manage? Secrets, tips? Stay at
home? Work full time? Work part time?)

</li>
<li>
Good places to take kids on weekends. (Gilroy Garlic, Doof-a-palooza,
Art & Wine fest, etc.)

</li>
<li>
Good places to take the kids every day. (Mercy/Bush park, Rinconada
Pool, Vasona County Park, Rancho San Antonio, etc.)

</li>
<li>
Fun techie dad products. (cool strollers, best toy stores around,
BPA-free bottles, GPS wristbands, etc.)

</li>
<li>
Other random dad-type musings about kids, family, life, or anything.

</li>
<li>
How do you manage your relationship? Babysitters? Date night? Something
else?

</li>
So, would you contribute? Would you read? Comment or e-mail me offline
if you're really excited about this and want to get started soon....
(Oh, and feel free to pass this post on if you know someone who would
fit the bill...)

NB: I know about the PAMP dads e-mail lists, and I was once on them, but
I really didn't see any good actual "Dad" content there. It was all
posts like "whats the best car repair shop in Redwood City" and stuff
like that, which is fun & useful, but not really the kind of info that I
was looking for.

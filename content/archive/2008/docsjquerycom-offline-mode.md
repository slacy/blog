This weekend,
[docs.jquery.com](http://docs.jquery.com "docs.jquery.com") was offline,
and I was really annoyed, because its hard to program for an API when
you can't get to the documentation.

So, I did the thing that bad internet users do, and crawled the entire
site and stored it locally.Â  Its 138MB uncompressed, and only 5.4MB as a
compressed .tar.bz2. I looked briefly at using the MediaWiki tools to
create a mirror of it, but it just seemed way to easy to fire off a big
wget (-E --mirror -k -p).

Let me know if you want a copy and I can e-mail it to you or put it up
on my other server.

After a quick quest to Fry's to see what the difference between the Acer
Aspire One and the Lenovo S10 is, I decided that the Acer was way too
cheap feeling, and that the Lenovo was worth the extra \~\$50.  So, I
put in my purchase (with IBM Employee Purchase discount from the family)
and it should be on its way.  Hooray!

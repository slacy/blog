slacy.com had a bit of a hardware issue -- it seems as though my power
supply blew up a couple of days ago.

I'm happy to announce that, after getting a new power supply, and
rewiring the guts of the beast, your friendly slacy.com is back up in
business and serving.

NB: Yes, I got that whole hosted server thats doing kleinlacy.com.  Now
I just need to \*really\* migrate everything over.  I don't really have
any excuses anymore. :)

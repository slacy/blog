Normally, these sorts of amusements aren't worth mentioning, but [this
version of
'launchball'](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/launchpad/launchball/) is
really fantastic implementation of games in the 'rube goldberg machine
building' genre. The twist here is that it uses real 'scientific'
principles like heat, magnetism, steam, solar, and wind power. I really
enjoyed it.

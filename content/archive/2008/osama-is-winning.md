So, we've got an economy in the tank, a war that can't be won (on
multiple fronts), a housing market in the dumps, and a credit crunch of
scale never seen before, and we're going to have a tax cut to stimulate

My only question is: How do I get myself out of this huge mess that this
administration has allowed to happen?

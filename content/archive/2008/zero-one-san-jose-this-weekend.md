Everybody go downtown for the [Zero One San Jose](http://01sj.org) art
festival.

We went last year, and it was pretty fun. They had a bunch of outdoor
art exhibits, projectors, music, and just random stuff everywhere. Check
out the web site for scehdules. We'll try to head down on Friday
evening...

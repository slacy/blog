Does anyone here have experience working in a
[Holacracy](http://holacracy.org/)-based organization? I just learned
about it via a blog post on [The Sunny Way]() and am reading [the
Holacracy
whitepaper](http://holacracy.org/downloads/HolacracyIntro2007-06.pdf)
now.

It sounds like an interesting idea, but I've never heard of it, which
makes me a bit suspect, and I actually can't find much supporting
information about it on the internet. ([Brian J. Robertson's
blog](http://enlightenedbusiness.blogspot.com/) hasn't been updated in
over a year, the Yahoo Group says that it was moved/retired in Oct 2007,
and doesn't say where it was moved, and there's no wikipedia entry on
Holacray, and no amazon.com matches for a search on "holacracy")

Additionally, most of the info seems to be focusing on "seminars" and
"upcoming events" which to me is somewhat of a signal that this is all a
bit dodgy.

Has anyone here read of Holacracy? Have you read the whitepaper? What do
you think? Do you think its something that can be put into practice?

My friend Rich pointed me at daytrotter.com, and it looks like they have
a really nice collection of live recordings by a bunch of interesting
artists. All the files are available for download on their site, so
using some trickery, I created a [txt file of all the mp3
URLs](http://slacy.com/blog/wp-content/daytrotter_music.txt) so that you
can use the same old wget trick to download them all. Watch out, there's
869 files in there, so I'd expect over 4GB of music...

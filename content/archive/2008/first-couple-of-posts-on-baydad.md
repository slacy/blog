So, [BayDad](http://baydad.com) is setup and running. I've written the
first 2 posts, and am still trying to set the tone of the blog, so bear
with me. Yes, the blog template & formatting needs some work, but that
can come later.

I'll also take this opportunity to make a call for any other bay area
dads that are interested in blogging about being a dad. Send me an
e-mail and I'll create you an account! Even "expectant dads" are
welcome! (wink, wink)

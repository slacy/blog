[Here's a link to maximumcompression.com's tests of a whole host of
different compressors and how they did on a large
fileset.](http://www.maximumcompression.com/data/summary_mf.php)

This list seems a bit old, and paq8o10 (a newer version than tested) has
been around for a little while. More crazy compression stuff can be
found on the [encode.ru forums](http://encode.ru/forums).

Hi, I'm Steve, nice to meet
you. [![](http://slacy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/headshot-300x300.png "headshot"){.alignright

I'm a Software Engineer living in the heart of Silicon Valley.  I worked
at Google from 2005 to 2010, and for the majority of that time, I was
the Tech Lead of the Video Streaming & Storage team.  I also spent time
working on the Storage Infrastructure team, and on the Ads Quality team.
 You can see more at [my LinkedIn
profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/slacy).

Prior to Google, I worked at TiVo doing full-stack development, mostly
focusing on middleware and architecture for Pioneer and DIRECTV
products.

I attended Carnegie Mellon University for my undergraduate degree in
Computer Science, and have been living here in Silicon Valley since
1994.

Today, I'm an entrepreneur working on [Proovn](http://proovn.com/).  My
goal is to radically improve hiring & recruiting for Software Engineers.

to you in a timely manner.  Thanks for visiting!

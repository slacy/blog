So, what's the best translation of this phrase into English?  I'm not
sure I trust Google (since "fucking motherfucker" doesn't translate
right back to "perkeleen vittupää" I suspect the translation is
imperfect or hard to express)  To that end, I've translated the phrase
to several languages, and then back to english for comparison:

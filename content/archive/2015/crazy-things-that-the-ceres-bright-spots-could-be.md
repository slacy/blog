Here's a quick list of some crazy things that the Ceres bright dots
could (or could not) be.

1.  A Biological Alien City

    Unlikely.  Current measurements of reflectivity of the spots says
    "they're as reflective as water ice" or, in other terms "white
    as snow".  Now, that's not to say that there couldn't be a race of
    aliens who have constructed a completely white city (complete with
    nearby suburbs!) but it seems quite unlikely.

    For biological life, there needs to be lots of other things present,
    likely water, source of food energy, like other plants and/or
    animals, or some kind of "Food farm".  We could be looking at the
    top of a "biodome" type structure, enclosing a habitation
    environment, though.   (As below, likely coated in something like
    Titanium Dioxide to reduce heat & radiation exposure)

    1.  A Mechanical Alien City

        By "Mechanical Alien" I mean "Machine Intelligence" or more
        simply: "robots from outer space".  This seems more likely than
        any form of biological alien.  If the spots are created
        by aliens, then why would they choose Ceres over all the other
        nearby planets?  One simple choice would be the presence of
        unique or rare elements in Ceres' crust or core.  Mechanical
        life could be attracted by an abundance of rare elements like
        Gallium or Titanium or even Helium (or tons of other options).

        We could be looking at a drilling or mining station and outpost,
        or even a single large mechanical life-form that's working,
        stranded or crashed in that location.   Remember that when you
        think about mechanical life, all assumptions about size & scale
        can be thrown out the window.  This could be a colony of
        trillions of small machines, or one single big one, or something
        in between.

        <p>
        This even (somewhat) could explain the "white as ice" nature of
        the spots.  If you were to make machines capable of interstellar
        travel, what color would you make the ships? Probably very, very
        white -- this would give you maximum visibility in space, but
        also maximum reflectivity (or control thereof) to minimize the
        heating from nearby sun(s).  There are several common elements
        that would lead to the white nature -- Something like a thin
        coating of Titanium Oxide on the surface of a building
        or machine.   The interesting point about this is that it also
        explains the Infrared readings showing that some of the spots
        were not cooler than their surroundings, and I believe that
        white titanium dioxide would almost exactly match this behavior,
        since it's highly reflective to Infrared radiation.

2.  Some kind of "Beacon"
    <p>
    Something left behind by a biological or mechanical intelligence.  
    Also seems unlikely -- if this were truly meant as a beacon of some
    sort, then why just reflective and not emissive?
3.  Water or Carbon Dioxide Ice

    The weird thing about this is that on a planet with little to no
    atmosphere, the common belief is that over several millenia,
    anything on the surface gets coated by dust from the impact ejecta
    from the constant bombardment of meteors.

    So, for there to be surface-exposed ice in such a large volume (many
    km across) and for it to not be covered in ice, it either needs to
    be a very recent feature (recent impact exposing sub-surface ice) or
    an active geological feature.  Because this is at the center of a
    crater that doesn't appear to be recent, we then assume that this is
    an active geological feature, erupting out sub-surface ice in a
    somewhat constant manner.

    <p>
    But, science measurements from Dawn's onboard Infrared cameras have
    shown that this region (Spot 5) is \*not\* cooler than its
    surroundings, so that sort of negates the possibility of some sort
    of ice.

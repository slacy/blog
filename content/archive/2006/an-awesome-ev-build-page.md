The guys at [ProEV](http://proev.com) have built a really amazing car
(the "Electric IMP") from a lot of the same parts that I've been
thinking of using. They've got tons of details about motors,
controllers, batteries, etc. What I've been thinking of doing is almost
exactly half of the IMP. 1 Siemens, and \~200V with (hopefully) LiIon
batteries, like the Kokam's they're using. Awesome info guys!

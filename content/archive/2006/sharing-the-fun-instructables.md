[Instructables](http://instructables.com) has lots of innovative and fun
looking projects.

I particularly liked the [LED
Throwies](http://www.instructables.com/ex/i/7DBB34EAEDFF1028A1FC001143E7E506/?ALLSTEPS)
& [Twisted Spoke Bicycle Wheel
Lacing](http://www.instructables.com/ex/i/9E8C2D9661D21028A786001143E7E506/)

I find Instructables cool because of the variety of projects. From
[hardcore
electronics](http://www.instructables.com/ex/i/9584C592E5B110289254001143E7E506/),
to [burning-man style
bikes](http://www.instructables.com/ex/i/FA794C5A93601028B929001143E7E506/),
to [Pesto Egg
Crepes](http://www.instructables.com/ex/i/F73D5B2E92721028B929001143E7E506/),
all on one site. Its fun just reloading the home page, which always
shows 3 random projects. I'm also intrigued by the flickr-style image
stuff they're using. Its cool.

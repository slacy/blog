So, we flew to a wedding this weekend. Two things happened that made me
extremely disappointed by the TSA at the major metropolitan airports
that we flew from.

First, When I was packing my carryon bag for the return flight, I
realized that I had left a large bottle of suntan lotion in the bag
(which we usually use when we go hiking.) Clearly, this falls under the
label "liquid or gel" but the bag screeners didn't pick up on it, and
didn't make me remove it.

Second, when we arrived back home, I realized that we had bought some
perishable food items, which were cooled by one of those freezer "gel"
packs of ice. I didn't even think about it being a problem until I
unpacked the bag! Clearly, this is a "gel" (and a suspicious chemical
gel in an odd plastic bag, at that). The screeners at the airport
completely missed it.

So, thats two things that are prohibited, and I accidentally took them
on the plane, and no one noticed. Why do they have these rules if they
can't enforce them? The TSA needs to either drop these rediculous rules,
or start to actually enforce them. What a joke.

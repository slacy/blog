Yes. Its true. I despise [amazon.com](http://amazon.com). Or, better
said, I despise what amazon.com has become. Why? One simple picure will
illustrate my point completely. This is an actual screenshot from
amazon, and has not been doctored other than cropping. Click to zoom

And now for the long rant... I despise amazon.com becase of their
"Marketplace Sellers" feature, where multiple sellers have the same item
for sale, at different prices, with seller ratings. This poses the
following problems for the consumer:

-   amazon.com is undermining their own business. I think of amazon.com
    as the place I can go to buy *any* book. As this screenshot shows,
    not all books are sold directly by amazon, and the buying experience
    is so confusing and muddled as to be essentially impossible.
-   Having too many choices. A user faced with a choice between 11
    different resellers for the same product. Why is it *my* job to
    choose? I want an easy, seamless and "guaranteed" buying experience!
-   Ratings, ratings, and more ratings. How is the consumer supposed to
    choose between the reseller with 97% positive out of 15,000 ratings
    at a slightly higher price, or the reseller with 95% positive out of
    500 ratings at a lower price? Why are they faced with this choice at
    all? On what merit, other than these 2 numbers, are they choosing?
    Why can't amazon guarantee a "100% satisfaction guaranteed"
    experience?
-   No "100%" solution. Even the highest rated reseller is only
    97% positive. That means 3 out of 100 had a bad experience. What if
    someone said "give me your money, and there's a 97% chance I'll send
    you your book.". Well, thats as good as it gets with this amazon
    reseller system. Reseller ratings for this item are as low as 85% --
    thats about a 1 in 6 chance of having a bad experience. Is this the
    level of quality that amazon supports?
-   Too many prices. For this item, prices range from a low of \$42.96
    to a high of \$92.79. Thats a spread of 2.15x. Why such a large
    price variation? Is something wrong with the cheap version? Is the
    expensive seller gouging?
-   What is the "list price" of this item? All new books have a price
    printed right on them. I want to see that price, and I want to pay
    that price, or lower. Why isn't it listed?
-   Is the product "New", "Nearly New", "In New Condition", "Like
    New", etc. I don't know if this is a used product or not, from most
    of these sellers. Hardly a good buying experience
-   If I wanted eBay.com, I would have gone to eBay.com. Enough said.
-   Totally unrelated advertisements in the page. See the following

   Sheet Music for Sailing? Give me a break! I mean, there are "Sheets"
    in Sailing, but they have absolutely nothing to do with music, thats
    for sure.

Again, I despise amazon, and I still want [This
book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0713668679/ref=olp_product_details/103-5705130-9051001?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155).

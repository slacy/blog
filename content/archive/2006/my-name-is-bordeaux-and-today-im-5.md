Hi, my name is Fedora Core "Bordeaux", and today I am 5. When I turned 4
last year, they got a funny salesman to talk about me like I was a toy.
I like toys. But today Teacher said I am a big kid, and I should talk
about myself. I can do lots of big kid stuff now, and everyone tells me
that I play really well with all the other kids in class, even the ones
who are mean like bullies. I always try and share, which is what Teacher
says is the best thing.

Sharing is a really good thing to do. I like to share all my toys and
books and stuff with all the other kids so that they can play with them
and even learn things, too. I have a lot of neat stuff to share, so I
made this cool list to tell you all about it. Teacher gave me some
things to put in the list, but since I'm a big kid I think I should get
to say what I want, too.

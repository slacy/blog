They're "prismatic" NiMH batteries  
1 "module" = 6 \* 1.2V in series = 7.2V, rated 6.5Ah, weighs 1kg  
1 "pack" = 38 "modules" in series = 273V, 6.5Ah  
Discharge power capability: 20kW at 50% SOC. (25kW = 33hp)

I'm not sure how many "packs" per car, but I would assume at least 2,
probably 4 or 6. I'm sure this info is around somewhere.

It uses a forced air cooling system.  
There are lots of interesting pictures in the linked PDF above.

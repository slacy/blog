I've had this long-standing theory that what the world needs is an
"Electric Formula-1" class. Why? Because the world needs the following
things:

-   Something to push the limits of EV (Electric Vehicle) technology
    (batteries, charging, motors, weight, etc.)
-   Something to get the major auto manufactureres (even if its just
    Ferrari, Mclaren and friends) to start building advanced "no limits"
    EV technology.
-   Something to change the image of EVs from "old, clunky, slow & short
    range" into "wickedly fast, long range, and cool"
-   Something to force the technology of road-worthy EV's into the hands
    of the general public.

To this end, I give you [NEDRA](http://nedra.com). The National Electric
Drag Racing Association. Its not quite F1, but its rolling in the right
direction. These guys have some totally insane vehicles! The short
version: The best electric dragsters are running competitively with the
best gas/nitro powered machines. Thats a *huge* step in the right
direction. Good work guys. Now, you just need to get those cars going a
little bit farther than a quarter mile. How about 10 laps around a 3
mile track, with a 60 second recharge time?

Once you change the way you think about cars, fuel, and gasoline,
there's no going back. That said, here's 2 things to think about:

1\. Air friction goes up with the square of velocity. So, the amount of
force it takes to go 60 MPH is quadruple what it takes to go 30 MPH. So,
why is it again that my gasoline powered car uses more gasoline
traveling an average speed of 30MPH than it does travelling 60MPH? If my
car can get a modest 20 MPG in stop-and-go traffic, why does it get
\*better\* mileage going 60MPH down the freeway? The reason: Its
insanely inefficient at low speeds. What should be happening is that if
I can get 25MPG on the highway, then I should be getting 100MPG on the
city streets. Too bad its the opposite.

2\. If your commute to work is 2 miles on surface streets, like mine is,
and your car averages 20 MPG during those commutes, then you're using
1/10 gallon of gas every time you drive to and from work. 1/10 gallon =
12.8 fluid ounces. So, each time I drive to work, its like burning a
full soda can of pure gasoline. What would it be like to fill up a soda
cans with gas and lite the on fire? I bet the cops would come and arrest
me if I did that it my driveway. With this puny commute, thats what I'm
doing twice a day. Ugh. I feel so dirty.

I really should ride my bike more.

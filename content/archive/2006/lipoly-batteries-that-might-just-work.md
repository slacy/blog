[Kokam](http://www.kokam.com/english/product/battery_main.html) sells
Lithium Polymer batteries that might just be usable in an EV. The guys
at ProEV say that the 70 amp/hr battery is \$362.60 each, and the 40
amp/hr battery is \$207.20 each, and that bulk discounts are available.
(But I'm not sure what constitutes "bulk") At 3.7 volts each (nominal),
it takes quite a few of these to get into vehicle-range voltages
(144-288V), but the price numbers are almost reasonable when you
consider that they'll last 4 or 5 times longer than lead-acid batteries.
If thats really true, then the prices are almost comparable, and the
LiPoly batteries are about 1/4 to 1/5 the weight, and that means more
range, and better performance.

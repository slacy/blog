In case you have been having trouble getting to slacy.com, its because
of the [DDoS attack that was happening to
joker.com](http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/172), which is where I
have my domain names registered, and its also where my DNS is hosted.  I
think when things expire, I won't continue with
[joker](http://joker.com).  I'll have to find a better registrar with
DNS service, or switch to freedns and some super-cheap registrar.

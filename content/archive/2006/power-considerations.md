A standard AA-sized Lithium Ion battery (Panasonic, etc.) will produce
3.6V, maximum draw of 95A, and contains 2.4Ah (Amp Hours) of energy.
Let's assume you don't want to ever draw at 95A, so reduce that to
\~50%, \~50A.

3.6V \* 50A = 180 Watts = 0.25 hp

So, if we want a maximum power output of about 100hp, we'll need 400 of
this size battery.

Since each cell has 2.4Ah in them, you'll be able to draw 50A for about
180 seconds. So, each 400-cell pack gives us 3 minutes of runtime at 100
hp.

Let's assume that highway driving doesn't take the full 100hp, but that
it takes 50hp, giving us 6 minutes time per 400-cell pack. We want 2
hours of runtime (2 hours @65mph), so we'll need 20 such 400-cell packs.

So, total: 8000 3.6V 2.4maH cells. How much does each one cost?
Somewhere between \$2 and \$10, but I'm not positive at these
quantities.

Each battery weighs 45.5g, so 8000 weigh in at 802 pounds. Seems like a
lot, but I'm not sure how this compares to the overall weight of an
[ICE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine) and
related drivetrain.

The guy from <http://wrightspeed.com> says he spent \$40k on LiIon
batteries. That seems like a bit much to me, but is in the right
ballpark.

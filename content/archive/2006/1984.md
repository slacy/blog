Well, take a look at this:

What you're looking at is a screen shot of
[dosbox](http://dosbox.sf.net) running [DisplayWrite
1.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayWrite), from 1984. This is what
I used in highschool on my [PCjr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PCjr)
and [IBM Convertible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Convertible) to
write my english papers and stuff.

I was able to recover one of the 720k floppies that had DisplayWrite and
most of the papers that I wrote in my Junior and Senior years in
highschool ('88-89 & '89-90). I've got about a dozen different papers,
which I'll convert and publish here soon, with hopefully some background
about each one.

Another interesting note was that the 720k single sided 3.5" floppy
discs were mostly recoverable, and very few, if none of the 1.44M double
sided discs were. Interesting?

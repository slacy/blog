I'm about to embark on Geotagging my photos with Linux. Basically, this
will amount to:

1\. Figuring out the right way to add Lat/Long information as EXIF data
to my photos.  
2. Figuring out the right gallery2 plugin to parse, import, and display
this info in a reasonable way. Optionally, generate Google Earth .KML
files for albums, display inline maps, display an overview map, etc.  
3. Figuring out how to associate a .GPX log file (from a handheld GPS)
and associate it with a large set of images, to automatically add EXIF
data. (I believe that gps2photo, below, will do this).  
4. Automating everything in a reasonable way such that its not too much
work when I upload photos.

To that end, here's a list of some useful starting points for software.
I don't think that there's any software out there that does all of this,
but I'm still looking.

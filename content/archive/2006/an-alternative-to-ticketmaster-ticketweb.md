In the past, I only knew about 2 online sources of concert tickets:
[Ticketmaster,](http://ticketmaster.com) and
[Ticketweb.](http://ticketweb.com) Ticketmaster being the incarnation of
evil, and ticketweb being the slightly less evil alternative.

Now, it seems like there's a third player:
[Virtuous.](http://virtuous.com/) Here's a quote from their website:

> Every Virtuous ticket purchase helps support people in need, close to
> home. How? 10% of our profit from each ticket purchase helps support
> the local food bank serving the community hosting the event.For
> example, each ticket purchased for a Los Angeles event will help the
> <span class="charity">Los Angeles Regional Food Bank</span> obtain and
> deliver much needed food for the 350,000 individuals they serve each
> week through their network of over 1,070 charities in Los Angeles
> County.

They've got a bunch of interesting stuff coming up in San Francisco. The
one that caught my eye was a show called
"[Mortified](http://getmortified.com)" at the [Make Out
Room](http://makeoutroom.com). Unfortunately, we'll be out of town this
weekend, so we'll have to miss it. Maybe you can make it?

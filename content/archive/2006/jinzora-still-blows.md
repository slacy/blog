I just thought I'd see if [Jinzora](http://jinzora.org) had made any
progress with putting together a good web-based music interface. So, I
downloaded and installed jinzora 2.6. The verdict: JINZORA STILL BLOWS!

It hung after spending about an hour importing 2/3 of my music (\~16,000
songs). Not much more I can do at this point. Maybe they'll have a 3.0
release that actually works for music collections of the 25,000 song
size.

EDIT: I'm now using [Ampache](http://ampache.org) for music serving, and
it totally ROCKS.

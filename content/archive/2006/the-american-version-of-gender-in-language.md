Many romance languages have a gender for each noun. But, we don't have
this in English, and I always wonder what its like to just "know" what
gender some random object should be.

Never fear! In American English, I realized that for most food-nouns, we
have something nearly equivalent to gender: Foil vs. Plastic Wrap!

Take a look at this list...

Brownies: Foil  
Rice Crispie Treats: Plastic Wrap

Pizza: Foil  
Cheese: Plastic Wrap

Cupcakes: Foil  
Frosting: Plastic Wrap

Bread: Foil  
Sandwiches: Plastic Wrap

Cooked Hamburgers: Foil  
Raw Hamburger: Plastic Wrap

I'm sure there are more...

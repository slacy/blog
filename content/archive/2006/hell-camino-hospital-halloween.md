Sorry I'm so late with the blog post, but here are some photos of "Hell
Camino Hospital" that we built this year for Halloween. It was a
fantastic success, and a heck (not hell) of a lot of fun. We were
handing out "prescriptions" at the reception desk, and then
trick-or-treaters went down the radiation hallway (green lights) to the
pharmacy desk, where they turned in their prescriptions for candy. This
year, we opted for real "construction" and are hoping that we'll be able
to reuse and re-decorate the walls for something fun next year as well!
Much thanks to everyone who helped the design, build, stenciling,
painting, wiring, and running of the whole thing!

(Oh, and for those of you who aren't in the bay area, the inspiration
came from [El Camino Hospital](http://www.elcaminohospital.org/) thats
right near where we live, and is a great place, from what I've heard.)

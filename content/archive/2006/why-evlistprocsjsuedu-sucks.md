Okay, I really hate to write this post, but I've been subscribed to
ev@listproc.sjsu.edu for a while now, and I've gotten almost zero useful
information from it. I'm tempted to write up something similar for them
to read, but I figure if they search around enough, maybe they'll find
this and learn something.

1\. I don't care about your drag racing. Really. Just stop it. I don't
care. Here's an editied excerpt from a post:

Give it a fricking break dude! I don't care! Just listen to yourself!
Look at how many times you mentioned the name of your car! How many
times do you mention 0-60. I DON'T CARE!

2\. Unbearable long "I just got back from vacation and here's what I did"
posts. You know the kind. There's always that one guy at work who writes
these e-mails that are 5 pages long, going on and on about how wonderful
his trip to Juba-Juba was. Well, on the EV list, this happens several
times a week, except its not about a vacation, its about some inane and
irrelvant subject, and its boring and useless.

Do I care? No.

3\. Dissing each other's electric cars. There has been a long thread over
the last few days thats saying what a terrible thing the Tesla Roadster
is. How can \*any\* production EV be a terrible thing? Most people are
saying that its too expensive, and that no one needs an EV that fast.
(see drag racing above?). I think its because a lot of the people put in
their blood sweat, tears and many, many dollars into their cars. What
they get is a used hunk-o-junk that barely goes on the highway. Tesla
offers a real sports car, for a little more money, with a lot more
performance.

4\. No information at all about AC drivetrains. Everybody has a DC setup,
and yet every production electric car ever made has had an AC
drivetrain. Why no info? Whats wrong?

5\. Lots and lots of "inside jokes". When I read the list, I feel like
I've stepped into some kind of "EV club" where new members aren't
welcomed. Lots of jokes about "Frank Grimes messed up my motor" (when
Frank is really a guy who rebuilds motors, apparently) and then first
and second degree derivative inside jokes, which last for 4 or 5 days.
Is this really related to EVs at all? No.

6\. Drifting threads and subject lines make it impossible to sort the
"good" from the "crap". I would be okay with all this crap, if it
weren't interleaved with the seemingly "good" messages. The whole list
becomes unbearable if you can't just ignore irrelavent threads.

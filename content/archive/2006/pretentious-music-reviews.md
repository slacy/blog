I was going to write a post about how much great music has just been
released. Maybe that will happen later. In the mean time, check out this
quote from the e-music review of the [Mountain Goats latest
album](http://www.emusic.com/album/10944/10944062.html):

> "Woke Up New," an ersatz calypso confessional, charts a painfully
> quotidian re-emergence from coupledom, while the more dire "Half Dead"
> counterpoints lyrical fatalism with agitated twang.

If I didn't already love the Mountain Goats, I would run away screaming.

Do you know the difference between Streusel and Strudel? Just to settle
the argument, here's what the internet thinks:

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strudel):

> A strudel is a type of pastry that originated in Central Europe and is
> most often associated with Austrian and German cuisine. The best known
> kinds are Apfelstrudel (with apple) and Topfenstrudel (with Topfen,
> also called Quark)

[Dufflet.com](http://dufflet.com): (via Google searching for
"[define:streusel](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=define%3Astreusel+&btnG=Search)")

> STREUSEL: A crunchy topping used to cover pies, fruit crisps and
> coffeecakes. It has a high proportion of butter and sugar to flour and
> can contain any kind of chopped nut, oats and spices.

So there ya go.

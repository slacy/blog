Our street is lined with Camphor Laurel trees, and I was digging around
today to try to find some more information about them, and found out
some really disturbing information:

[Camphor Laurel has been classified as a "Class 3" weed by New South
Wales, and are referred to as "Killer
Camphors".](http://www.nrm.qld.gov.au/factsheets/pdf/pest/pp46.pdf)
(link is on a NSW government site) "Class 3" weeds are *required* to be
removed from places like National Parks, etc. in NSW.

[A fair number of seemingly outrageous claims on
camphorlaurel.com](http://camphorlaurel.com). I'm searching around now
for more information to back these claims up. The ones I find
particularly interesting are the supposed "addictive" effects on
wildlife, as well as the local watershed contamination.

[Safrole & Camphor Oil can be extracted from the Camphor Laurel, and is
considered a controlled substance by the DEA, because its used to
produce MDMA
(Ecstacy).](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/chem_prog/advisories/safrole.htm)

[Information about the toxicity of pure Camphor (a
chemical)](http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/camphor.htm)

[A report from the NIH about toxicity of over the counter products
containing camphor, particularly to infants &
toddlers.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15219304)

They're so beautiful! I just can't imagine that they're such nasty
trees! In fact, although I'm collecting information here, I don't really
want to know this sort of stuff...

My [AVR Wiki](http://slacy.com/wiki) has risen from the dead! Over 2
years ago, I ran a great [AVR
Microcontroller](http://atmel.com/avr)related wiki. That is, until I
attempted to upgrade the [wiki
software](http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net), and trashed the whole
database. Plus, I couldn't even get the new install up and running
again. Its garbage.

Well, today I finally got around to installing a new Wiki software
package, [MediaWiki](http://mediawiki.org), which is what powers
[Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.com), so I think it'll be pretty stable.
And, thanks to the [internet archive](http://archive.org), I was able to
browse back in time to those old pages, and resurrect them back into
life on the new site! Yay!

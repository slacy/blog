I just want to say that the HDTV content that NBC is broadcasting has
\*way\* too many ghosting artifacts. Its clearly evident in any high
motion scene thats broadcast. There's a clear ghost of the previous 3 or
4 frames. At first I thought it might be my TV or something, so captured
the raw MPEG-2 stream, and decoded it directly. Here's a scaled down
version of the full frame (click for full res). The ghosting is clearly
apparent around the poster on the left, as well as around all the
vertical black lines, and above the main character's head.

Here's a zoomed in version of the same thing, near the poster, at 1:1

I think this is caused by a too agrressive de-noising algorithm.
Hopefully they fix it before next season.

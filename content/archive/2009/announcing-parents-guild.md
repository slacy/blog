Just a quick note to my readers and searchers that we've launched our
new parenting website, [Parents Guild](http://parentsguild.com).  We've
got question & answering, e-mail notifications, tagging, voting, and a
bunch of other parenting-specific features in the works.  We've got
about 50 users so far, which is pretty great considering we haven't done
much marketing. :)   We're welcoming feedback (use the link on the left
hand side of the site, or comment here, or comment on the blog or
facebook).

Our goal is to make the site as welcoming and informative to as many
people as possible.  That includes Dads, Grandparents, parents of older
children, people without children, as well as expecting couples.  Come
on by and share ideas & advice!

[It's easy to sign up](http://parentsguild.com/account/register/) and
ask or answer a question!

We also have a [blog](http://blog.parentsguild.com) and a [facebook
page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Parents-Guild/189697752023?ref=nf),
so you can follow what we're doing on the site.

Despite what I had said previously, I'm now ***not*** recommending
installing solr & tomcat from ubuntu packages.

The version of solr that is provided by Ubuntu 9.10 is solr 1.2, which
is over 2 years old.Â  Installing directly from the solr .jar is likely
better.

Tomcat was kind of pain in the ass anyway. :)

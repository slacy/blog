Title: Crowdsourcing caffeine consumption.

Here's how it goes:

There are 2 coffee pots at work, one is caffeinated, and one is decaf.

If you get to work early enough (say, before 9am) then there's usually
enough caffeinated coffe left to have a cup.

But, if you get in too late (say, 10am) or if you go for a second cup of
coffee, all the early birds have drunk the caffeinated coffee, and
there's only decaf left.

It's like "wisdom of the crowds" telling me not to drink caffeinated
coffee after 10am.

If you're looking for mencoder options to produce an x264 encoding (.mp4
file), then you should look at
[this](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=101813) post.Â  It links
to a set of XML configuration files for MeGUI that are easy enough to
parse that you'll be able to turn them into an mencoder commandline
pretty easily.

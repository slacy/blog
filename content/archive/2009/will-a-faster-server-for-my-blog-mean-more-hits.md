I've been doing some experiments and data gathering for the traffic to
this blog.  I'm actually surprised by the Google Analytics numbers.  On
an average day, I get just about 150 unique visitors per day, summing to
about 4,000 unique visitors per month.  That number really surprises
me.  Who are these people?  Where do they come from?

And, more importantly, what factors make those numbers go up and down. 
So, I've decided to move my blog hosting from my home DSL line (a
congested 768kbps uplink) to my hosted server (essentially unlimited,
but practically can send 10Mbps if you can consume it).  This means that
you should have a much faster experience when visiting slacy.com, and
crawlers will be able to more quickly consume my RSS feeds and content,
which may mean more traffic.

So, I'm going to wait a couple of weeks, and post again about whether I
saw any uplift of traffic to the site.  I suspect there may be a small
upward trend, but it's also possible that there could be a big jump...

UPDATE:
-------

Well, it's been a couple of weeks since I moved to the faster server,
and I've seen absolutely no increase in the amount of traffic to the
site.  I suspect that Google doesn't include site speed as a factor in
page rank (which is somewhat surprising, since the old server was quite
slow and had frequent outages).

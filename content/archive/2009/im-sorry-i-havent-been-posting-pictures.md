Just because they haven't been appearing on the website, it doesn't mean
we haven't been taking them.

What it does mean is that I had accumulated about 2,700 photos that I
needed to sort through, and I just wasn't able to find the time to do
it.  So, I've decided to take on a new approach, and upload them as "one
folder per day and one folder per month".  That way, the pictures will
go live, and everyone will be happy!  [Please click through to our

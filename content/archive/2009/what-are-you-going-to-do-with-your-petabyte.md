So, I just upgraded my home computer from 500GB of storage that was 95%
used to 2.0TB that's now only 25% used.

That's a fairly big jump, but the funny thing is, I imagine using up
2.0TB of content in another couple of years.  The biggest users of space
on my system are photos (150GB) and music (200GB), with lots of other GB
used up with random "small" files and my operating system.  I can easily
take photos (in JPG format, even) at the rate of about 4GB/week if I'm
active with my camera.  If I use RAW, I could likely do 4GB/day.

It's very likely that hard drive space is going to continue to grow,
even if the world switches to solid-state storage in the next decade,
I'd still expect to be able to buy 1PB (one petabyte = 1,000 terabytes)
of storage at your local computer store by the year 2020 for somewhere
in the \$100 price range.  Even if the industry switches to SSD
technology, I'd expect a 100TB SSD drive to be in this price range by
then.  (so if this happens, just divide the numbers below by 10).

The question is:  What will be filling that space up with?  CCDs on
cameras aren't really getting that much bigger, and we've already got
plenty of storage for photos.  Music isn't getting any more bytes than
44kHz \* 16bits \* 2 channels, and HD video at approximately 20Mbps is
pretty reasonable.

1PB = 111,111 hours (12.6 years) of HD video @ 20Mbps

1PB = 26.66 million 10 megapixel images stored as raw 30-bits per pixel

1PB = 1.5 million hours (179 years) of uncompressed 44kHz stereo audio

So, what do you think you're going to do with your PB?

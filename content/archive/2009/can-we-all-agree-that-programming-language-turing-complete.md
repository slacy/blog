I'm tired of articles like [this
one](http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/176223.asp) that say
things like

> XML essentially is a programming language that allows users to
> customize the underlying format of their word-processing documents

It peeves me a *lot* when people refer to things like XML and HTML as
"programming languages" because there's no actual programming (i.e.
control flow of execution and conditional statements, to start) involved
in using them.  They're document or data formats, and that's it.  HTML
is as much a programming language as a typewriter is a computer.

I hereby propose that we stop using the term "Programming Language" to
refer to anything that's not [turing
complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#Examples).

We can also [ask
google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22html+is+a+programming+language%22&aq=f&oq=&aqi=)
what it thinks [about the
matter](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22xml+is+a+programming+language%22&aq=f&oq=&aqi=)...

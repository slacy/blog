Just a quick note for another item that will be the death of flash:
Netbooks.

As the computer market continues to move down in CPU power, price and
size, the ability of a standard netbook to run sites like hulu.com has
become questionable. The little Atom 1.6GHz processor just doesn't have
enough oomph to play large-format videos. (Youtube.com works great, its
just the other sites that are pushing larger resolutions and larger
bitrates and more sophisticated codecs).

Additionally, flash is just something that sits there on web pages using
up your CPU, and that means that it's using up your battery, which is
bad. So, I've disabled flash altogether (via FlashBlock) on my netbook's
configuration, and I'm tempted to do so on my desktop machines as well.
FlashBlock gives a nice "click to play" experience that I really prefer
over the default of many sites which is to just start playing flash
videos & sound as soon as you enter the page.

Maybe the netbook processors are going to improve, and maybe that means
that in another year or so flash won't be such a big deal, but in the
interm, I think Adobe is in a pretty bad situation, especially due to
the mobile factors I mentioned in my last post...

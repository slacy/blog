I found this post on building43 somewhat interesting, but most relevant
to my current thoughts is this short passage:

> But this isn’t a strategy for startups. Little companies need a niche

So, my question is:  Why are voting based content sites so popular? 
Digg. Reddit, etc. all have had great success finding good content from
the mass of the internet, and they use user voting to do so.

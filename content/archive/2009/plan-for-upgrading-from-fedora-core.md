Ok, I've had it.  Fedora Core 8 MUST GO.

I've been procrastinating upgrading because the Fedora Upgrader
(anaconda) is so horrible and totally breaks pretty much my entire
computer every time I upgrade, so I've made the pledge to not upgrade
FC8 anymore, and just go straight to Ubuntu 9.04 on my desktop/server
machine.

I ordered 3\*1TB drives from NewEgg tonight (\$90/ea) and once those are
in my system, I'll be installing a shiny new Ubuntu 9.04 system. 
Sweet.  Hopefully this old clunker of a machine will last another year
with some new fast storage attached to it...

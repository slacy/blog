I just wanted to put the word out that there's a phone phishing scam
that's targeting me, and thought that many others may be effected.  I'm
receiving phone calls from:

-   \(415) 350-0333
-   <span id=":j7">(773) 266-7390</span>
-   <span>(704)</span><span id=":1kd">458-1206</span>

<span>The transcript of the message is:</span>

> This is American Express calling about a very important business
> matter. Your attention to this matter is urgently needed by the end of
> the day. Please call us at 1-800-678-0738 and please have your
> American Express account number available when you call.  We can be
> reached 24 hours a day.  Thank you.

Here's how this scam works:

They call you and they pretend to be AmEx and say that there's an urgent
fraud issue with your card, and need you to provide your account
number.  ***Never, EVER, provide your personal account number or
personal details to anyone who calls you.*** You should always initiate
the call, and you should call a known number, like the one on the back
of your card.

If you return the call to the 800 number above, it asks you to enter
your account number there as well. ***Never, EVER, give you account
number or personal details to a phone number that you're not 100% sure
is the legitimate business who issued your account***

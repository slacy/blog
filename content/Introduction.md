Title: Introduction
Tags: Tensorflow From The Ground Up## Introduction
Hello and welcome!  I'm Steve, and I'm an experienced Software Engineer, and I'm learning [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org).

One of the biggest questions that I had was: 

> How do I determine if I can solve a problem using Machine Learning?  Which problems will it work for, 
> and which ones will be a failure?  

This is an extremely important question, and most tutorials I found were lacking this type of low level context. 

There are many tutorials for Tensorflow on the internet, but I found that most of them (including ones included in the [Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/)) take a "top down" approach, usually starting with running an MNIST classifier on a pre-existing data set. 

These top down introductions are useful for people who have a dataset in mind, and who are ready to apply existing ML models to new (or existing) datasets, or for people who want to get a 10,000 foot view of what ML is and how it's applied in practice. 

Top down approaches aren't at all suited for those who would like to eventually gain a deep, thourough understanding of thesystems involved.  
## Goals 
I have some rough goals in mind, which I'll quickly outline here, mostly to keep myself focused: 

1. Approach machine learning from the **bottom up**.  
2. Build **intuititon** around the tools and processes used in ML. 
3. Use **exploratory** methods, showing different approaches to solving the same problem.
4. Aim for **deep** understanding of the systems involved. 
## Tools
For this blog, I'm using a new collection of tools, which I've somewhat hand-configured for the purpose.  I may go into more detail in later posts. The rough collection of tools I'm using is: 

* [Pelican Static Blogging](https://getpelican.com) Software for content generation.
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting. 
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) for authoring all posts. 
* Ubuntu & Linux hardware with nVidia GPU accelleration as my runtime.

Hello and welcome to *Tensorflow from the Ground Up*!  I'm Steve, and I'm an experienced Software Engineer, and I'm learning [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org).

One of the biggest questions that I had was: 

> How do I determine if I can solve a specific problem using Machine Learning?  
>
> Which problems will it work for, and which ones will be a failure?  
>
> How do I design an ML graph from scratch? 

These are extremely important questions, and most tutorials I found were lacking this type of low level deph and context. 

There are many tutorials for Tensorflow on the internet, but I found that most of them (including ones included in the [Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/) itself) take a "top down" approach, usually starting with running an MNIST classifier on a pre-existing data set. 

These top down introductions are useful for people who have a specific dataset or application in mind, or for those who are ready to apply *existing ML models* to new or existing datasets.  They're also useful for people who want to get a 10,000 foot view of what ML is and how it's applied in practice. 

Top down approaches aren't at all suited for developers who would like to gain a deep, thourough understanding of the systems, processess, and APIs involved.  
## Goals 
I have some rough goals in mind, which I'll quickly outline here, to keep myself focused: 

1. Approach machine learning from the **bottom up**.  
2. Build **intuititon** around the tools and processes used in ML. 
3. Use **exploratory** methods, showing different approaches to solving the same problem.
4. Aim for **deep** understanding of the systems involved. 
## Tools
For this blog, I'm using a new collection of tools, which I've hand-configured for this purpose.  I may go into more detail in later posts. The collection of tools I'm using is: 

* [Pelican Static Blogging](https://getpelican.com) Software for content generation.
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting. 
* [Python](https://python.org) for all source code. 
* [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.com) for my ML framework. 
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) for authoring all posts. 
* Ubuntu & Linux hardware with nVidia GPU accelleration as my runtime.

        <p>So, I had my first chance to play with a TiVo <span class="caps">HD</span> over the holiday
weekend, and I&#8217;ll say, it was a pretty nice box. I&#8217;m especially fond of
the <span class="caps">HD</span> loopsets! Nice work,&nbsp;guys.</p>
<p>One feature that I was very anxious to try out was the new &#8220;Swivel&nbsp;Search&#8221;.</p>
<p>First, I was a bit perplexed by the long &#8220;startup&#8221; time. None of the
searches under <span class="caps">PPTR</span> (is it still called that?) have a startup time, but
this one does. And its kinda long.&nbsp;Yuk.</p>
<p>Then, as I started to type on the virtual keyboard, I noticed that it
had significantly worse response time than the regular <span class="caps">PPTR</span> name search
boxes. I think I know why, and I think its because this TiVo <span class="caps">HD</span> isn&#8217;t in
the contiguous 48 states. <span class="caps">HME</span> had a pretty bad lag time from Honolulu,
so searching was more difficult than it should have&nbsp;been.</p>
<p>I was hoping for a Google-esque search box for <span class="caps">TV</span> listings. Something
where I could type &#8220;Simpsons&#8221; and see a list of all ump-teen seasons and
episodes with titles, descriptions, season identifiers and episode
numbers for all of them. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t do this. It still
seems to only show &#8220;available&#8221; shows (next 2 weeks of <span class="caps">PGD</span> plus Amazon
Unbox and friends). Why not let me see *everything*? Thats what I
really&nbsp;want!</p>
<p>I was hoping for a search box where I could type &#8220;Steve Martin&#8221; (or just
&#8220;Martin&#8221;) and see a list of all my favorite movies. (without having to
go through the process of creating a WishList.) Unfornutately, this
didn&#8217;t work either. The search seems to be a title-only search. Huh? The
weird part was that I could search for &#8220;The Jerk&#8221; and see Steve Martin,
and navigate there to see all his upcoming movies. So, the functionality
is there, they just didn&#8217;t expose it in the search box. I found this
especially&nbsp;disappointing.</p>
<p>I tried searching for things that it might have classified as &#8220;Tags&#8221; (a
very vague concept, at the least), and couldn&#8217;t see that it was doing
anything more than simple title&nbsp;searching.</p>
<p>I thought it would be cool to search some of the other data in the <span class="caps">PGD</span>,
so I searched for &#8220;1998&#8221; to see if I could see all shows from that year.
No results. How&nbsp;odd.</p>
<p>Then, I tried to figure out what the &#8220;Swivel&#8221; part of SwivelSearch
refers to. Here&#8217;s a definition of&nbsp;&#8216;Swivel&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. a fastening device that allows the thing fastened to turn around
freely upon it, esp. to turn in a full circle.<br>
2. such a device consisting of two parts, each of which turns around
independently, as a compound link of a chain, one part of which turns
freely in the other by means of a headed pin or the like.<br>
3. a pivoted support allowing a gun to turn around in a horizontal
plane.<br>
4. a swivel gun.<br>
5. a device attached to a loom and used as a shuttle to weave extra
threads in the production of small figures, esp. dots.<br>
6. to turn or pivot on or as if on a swivel: He swiveled his chair
around.<br>
7. to fasten by a swivel; furnish with a swivel.<br>
8. to turn on or if as on a&nbsp;swivel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, exactly what are we swiveling&nbsp;on?</p>
<p>Is Swivel Search just like Find By Name, except that it searches Unbox
content? It seems less powerful than a reguar keyword-based wishlist
search, which isn&#8217;t saying much since the WishList search runs directly
on the TiVo, and the SwivelSearch runs on a big server in the sky, so it
should be a lot more powerful,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>For the long startup time and slow key response, and virtually no added
benefit, I just don&#8217;t get it. Am I missing&nbsp;something?</p>
<p>P.S.: I presume the term &#8220;swivel&#8221; is a synonym for &#8220;pivot&#8221; and refers to
the spreadsheet functionality of &#8220;pivot tables.&#8221; Unfortunately, its
*not* anything as powerful or useful as a pivot table. Oh&nbsp;well.</p>

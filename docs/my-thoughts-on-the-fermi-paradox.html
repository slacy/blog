        <p>There was an article on Slashdot not too long ago that talked about the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi paradox</a>, which
basically&nbsp;says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the universe is so big, why haven&#8217;t we seen or detected any
aliens&nbsp;yet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it got me thinking about it in a bit more detail. I&#8217;ve concluded
that its very likely that we&#8217;re not looking in &#8216;the right way&#8217; and that
&#8216;the right way&#8217; is a way that is more technologically advanced than
anything we know&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>In the time since the original statement of the Fermi Paradox in 1950,
we&#8217;ve learned the following&nbsp;things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you want to explore somewhere thats hard or dangerous to get to,
    its much easier to send a robot. (Mars, The Titanic,&nbsp;etc.)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a> (stated
    in 1965) says that things are getting smaller and
    cheaper exponentially. We have very little evidence to think that
    this would not&nbsp;continue.</li>
<li>Although travel at the speed of light sounds fun, its extremely
    unlikely to be possible for large objects. (Otherwise, we&#8217;d have
    been visited by &#8216;little green men&#8217; by&nbsp;now)</li>
<li>Quantum computing, and particularly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">quantum
    entanglement</a>,
    may offer a way to communicate instantly over stellar&nbsp;distances.</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_singularity">The Singularity</a>&#8221;
    may impact stellar exploration greatly, in a way thats impossible
    to&nbsp;predict.</li>
<li>There are many things, just like the ones above, that we do not yet
    know, and impact this&nbsp;equation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even considering only what we know today, we can surmise that there
haven&#8217;t been any &#8220;flying saucers&#8221; because its just too hard to travel
that far, even if they are very technologically advanced. I hypothesize
that alien civilizations could build microscopic exploration robots, and
send them speeding at near the speed of light through the universe
(using a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_accelerator">particle
accellerator</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_gun">rail
gun</a>). These microscopic robots
would use quantum entanglement to communicate back information about
what they saw. An intelligent civilization could send billions of such
robots (one per interesting star in the galaxy) and get reasonable
results in just a few hundred years, even less for very near stellar
systems. Such technology would make stellar exploration approximately as
difficult as extra-planetary exploration is for us today. That is to
say, it would make it possible with reasonable&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this sort of &#8216;alien&#8217; would be very difficult (or
impossible) for us to detect using our current technology, and thus, my
explanation of the Fermi paradox. One corrolary of this is that the
current <span class="caps">SETI</span> project is basically pointless, unless the
micro-exploration robots are programmed to emit brief pulses of radio
waves for people like us. If so, then <span class="caps">SETI</span> needs to be looking in our
near vacinity (with 1 A.U.) for signals from objects travelling very
quickly, not at stationary stars that are hundreds or thousands of light
years&nbsp;away.</p>

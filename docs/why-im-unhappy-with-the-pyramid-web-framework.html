    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Here I am, writing this post instead of coding.  Why?  Because I&#8217;m
having to read through the
<a href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/docs/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a> source code
trying to figure out what the heck is going on with configuration.  Or,
to be more specific, how can I load module X when I&#8217;m in production, but
module Y when I&#8217;m in&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>I find myself in this state pretty often, and I don&#8217;t mind reading the
source code.  Often times when using <a href="http://djangoproject.org">other
frameworks</a>, I&#8217;d learn something new about
Python when reading the&nbsp;source.</p>
<p>At it&#8217;s heart, the problem with Pyramid is also what makes it great:
 They don&#8217;t prescribe any one way to do anything.  It&#8217;s totally agnostic
to which database, template engine, session framework, and auth/auth
framework you want to use.  This is what I like.  What I don&#8217;t like is
that it also seems to not be able to make up it&#8217;s mind about some
things.  Is it repoze? Is it zope?  Is it paster?  Is it&nbsp;pyramid?</p>
<p>When I read the source to Pyramid, it makes me throw up in my mouth a
little bit.  Here are the high level points about Pyramid that really
get on my&nbsp;nerves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration.  You can configure this thing in 3 different ways.
     zope&#8217;s <span class="caps">ZCML</span> (<span class="caps">XML</span>-derived language), via the paster config language
    (looks like Microsoft .<span class="caps">INI</span> files), and via declarative configs (the
    Python code).   Why in the world they need 3 different ways to
    configure 1 framework is beyond me.
    <p>
    There&#8217;s a class for &#8220;Settings&#8221; and 2 different classes both named
    &#8220;Configuration&#8221;, one in pyramid.config, one in pyramid.configuration
    with odd deprecation messages in both places.  How can a web
    framework that just hit 1.0 have deprecated&nbsp;APIs?</li>
<li>Reliance on zope and repoze, paster, WebOb, Pygments, and a million
    other little libraries.  This means that figuring out something
    simple by reading code or docs leads down to bouncing between 2 or
    even 3 different libraries, trying to understand how they all
    fit together.  This is unnecessary and&nbsp;annoying.</li>
<li>zope.interface  Yes, this is super-annoying.  I&#8217;m not sure what
    value it adds, and seems very non-Pythonic to me.  I&#8217;ve never seen
    any other code that does&nbsp;this.</li>
<li>Anything related to zope.  It sucks.  <span class="caps">ZODB</span>?  Seriously?  Who would
    start a project today using this thing?  It seems to have stuck it&#8217;s
    legacy fingers in all over the place.  For example, routes vs.
    traversal.  Every other framework I&#8217;ve ever seen/used is doing
    something like routes.  Traversal (as best as I can tell) seems to
    be a <span class="caps">ZODB</span>-ism that&#8217;s worked its way in there, and confuses people
    all the&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>Lack of organized documentation.  The Pyramid web site looks great,
    but the actual contents of the documentation leaves a lot to
    be desired.  Figuring out simple things like configuration
    parameters, routes or traversal, which database to use (and how),
    user <span class="amp">&amp;</span> session objects, auth/auth, etc.  It&#8217;s all a mess.  Each
    section starts of with some great version of &#8220;Pyramid supports
    whatever you want&#8221; and then devolves into minutia of several
    possible half-baked&nbsp;solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>My recommendations for the Pyramid&nbsp;team:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ditch zope.  Yes, the whole thing.  Ditch <span class="caps">ZCML</span>, <span class="caps">ZODB</span> and&nbsp;traversal.</li>
<li>Ditch paster.  Like Pyramid itself, this feels good on the surface,
    but gets itchy under your&nbsp;skin.</li>
<li>Ditch repoze.  Take the parts you depend on, and pull them right
    into Pyramid itself.  Don&#8217;t depend on all of repoze just because
    you&nbsp;can.</li>
<li>Keep the flexibility, but start with a sane default.  Default
    to routes.  Default to a reasonable session implementation.  Default
    to a reasonable auth/auth&nbsp;implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p><span
style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 28px;">I&#8217;m
stuck with Pyramid for now, but since I&#8217;m still fairly early in this
process, I&#8217;m going to start looking around to see what it takes to
switch to another framework (likely flask or bottle, but I&#8217;m not&nbsp;sure)</span></p>

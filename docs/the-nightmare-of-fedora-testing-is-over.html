        <p>Well, I finally spent the time this weekend to upgrade my machine to
Fedora Core 4 release. Thank God. I&#8217;m finally off that awful Fedora Core
4 Test 3 release, and on to something thats production. Just to recap,
Test 3 was a nightmare&nbsp;because&#8230;</p>
<p>1. Many packages were missing or non-existant when I installed it,
leaving my system in a completely non-usable&nbsp;state.</p>
<p>2. Once installed, the updates to packages was relentless. There were
new versions of almost everything on a weekly basis. Many times, the yum
repository was in such a bad state that packages couldn&#8217;t be updated
because of bad dependencies in the repo itself. I can&#8217;t believe that
they let it get that bad, and for so long&nbsp;(weeks).</p>
<p>3. No warning or reasonable behavior for transitioning from <span class="caps">FC4T3</span> into
<span class="caps">FC4</span> Release. There was no warning, no message no nothing that said
&#8220;okay, we&#8217;ve frozen the repository, and there will be no updates until
<span class="caps">FC4</span> release.&#8221; What happened was the freeze happened, but there was no
notice given, and packages continued to change. Later on an &#8220;oh by the
way&#8230;&#8221; message was sent out saying that the repo was broken, and this
was okay because they had transitioned to <span class="caps">FC5</span>.</p>
<p>4. All the annoying people on the fedora-devel mailing list. You guys
all need to chill out. Week long threads about the virtues and ills of
&#8220;Top Posting&#8221; are rediculous. You&#8217;re like a bunch of 13 year&nbsp;olds.</p>
<p>There, I said it. Never ever again will I go to a Testing release of
Fedora Core, and I may never install <span class="caps">FC</span> on any new machine ever&nbsp;again.</p>

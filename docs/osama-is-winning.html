        <p>This news is from <strong>2004</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of the &#8220;bleed-until-bankruptcy plan,&#8221; bin Laden cited a
British estimate that it cost al Qaeda about \$500,000 to carry out
the attacks of September 11, 2001, an amount that he said paled in
comparison with the costs incurred by the United&nbsp;States.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Every dollar of al Qaeda defeated a million dollars, by the
permission of Allah, besides the loss of a huge number of jobs,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;As for the economic deficit, it has reached record astronomical
numbers estimated to total more than a trillion dollars.<br>
[&#8230;]<br>
All that we have to do is to send two mujahidin to the furthest point
east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaida, in order
to make the generals race there to cause America to suffer human,
economic, and political losses without their achieving for it anything
of note other than some benefits for their private&nbsp;companies.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s some news from <strong>2003</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his determination to cut taxes even while waging war in Iraq,
President Bush is bucking&nbsp;history.</p>
<p>With the exception of the war against Mexico in the 1840&#8217;s, taxes have
been increased for every war the United States has fought, ever since
most colonies increased property taxes to raise money to fight the
British in the American Revolution.<br>
[&#8230;]<br>
In the current situation, the Bush administration argues that a war
against Iraq is bound to be short and relatively inexpensive, so there
is no risk in cutting&nbsp;taxes.</p>
<p>&#8221;The cost of the war will be small,&#8221; Treasury Secretary John W. Snow
told the House Ways and Means Committee this week. &#8221;We can afford the
war, and we&#8217;ll put it behind&nbsp;us.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we&#8217;ve got an economy in the tank, a war that can&#8217;t be won (on
multiple fronts), a housing market in the dumps, and a credit crunch of
scale never seen before, and we&#8217;re going to have a tax cut to stimulate
the&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>My only question is: How do I get myself out of this huge mess that this
administration has allowed to&nbsp;happen?</p>

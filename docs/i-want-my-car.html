        <p>I want to buy a new car, but first, someone has to build it. Here&#8217;s what
it has to&nbsp;do:</p>
<p>1. Efficient hybrid. I think it should get 30% better mileage than the
<a href="http://www.toyota.com/prius/">Prius</a>, say 65mpg highway/75mpg&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>2. &#8220;Sporty&#8221;. I&#8217;m thinking something with agressive but &#8220;normal&#8221; styling.
Not as radical as the <a href="http://www.lotuscars.com/">Lotus Elise</a>. Maybe
something like the <a href="http://www.pontiac.com/solstice/">Pontiac Solstice</a>
but that doesn&#8217;t look like ass. If it looked like the <a href="http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/cayman/">Porsche
Cayman</a> or the Carerra <span class="caps">GT</span>,
that would be great. Maybe Porsche should make this thing. (Can anyone
say &#8220;Boxster&nbsp;H&#8221;?).</p>
<p>3. Small and Light. Its gotta be easy to park, low to the ground (for
aerodynamics and looks), short wheelbase for quick turning. Its got to
feel &#8220;high tech&#8221; with an aluminum frame (Lotus style) and doesn&#8217;t need
&#8220;luxury&#8221;. It should be small. Think Mazda Miata level of interior size
and comfort, or even less. It doesn&#8217;t have to be the svelt 2000 pounds
that the lotus is, but it also can&#8217;t be the 3700 pounds that my current
car is. Batteries are going to be the big issue here. Not sure how to
keep them light&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>4. Fast. If its small and light, it should be quick off the line. I&#8217;d
like to see a peak combined (electric <span class="amp">&amp;</span> gas) output of 200+ horsepower,
\~150 foot pounds of torque. I&#8217;d also like to see a large electric motor
bias &#8212; something like 70% electric 30% gas. I want it to basically run
like an electric car most of the time. Should have sub 6-second 0-60
time, at least. I&#8217;m not too concerned about quarter mile and 60-100
speeds. I know it won&#8217;t do well on those&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>5. Range. It doesn&#8217;t need a huge cruising range. 250 miles would be
fine. I&#8217;m thinking a 4 gallon gas tank, or something about that&nbsp;size.</p>
<p>6. Major brand. Its gotta be made by Honda, Mazda, Nissan, etc. I&#8217;m not
going to buy a
<a href="http://www.acpropulsion.com/tzero_pages/tzero_home.htm">tzero</a> or even
something like the&nbsp;Lotus.</p>
<p>7. Not outrageously priced. It needs to come in squarely at \$30k, and
it doesn&#8217;t have to have a lot of options to add on. I want it to come
nicely equipped out of the box, with a few cute add-ons, like custom
paint colors, and nice&nbsp;wheels.</p>
<p>8. Don&#8217;t design for the people who aren&#8217;t going to buy it. It doesn&#8217;t
need to have great winter amenities, it doesn&#8217;t need a spare tire, it
doesn&#8217;t need cargo space. Design for California and Florida, sell to
everyone who&#8217;s willing to buy&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The other way to describe it would be like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Honda delSol with less weight, a hybrid motor, and updated&nbsp;styling.  </li>
<li>A Lotus Elise with a hybrid motor, less radical styling, and&nbsp;cheaper.  </li>
<li>A Mazda Miata with a hybrid motor, and more agressive&nbsp;styling.  </li>
<li>A Pontiac Solstice that isn&#8217;t made by Pontiac, doesn&#8217;t have a frontend
that looks like ass, is faster, lighter, and is a&nbsp;hybrid.  </li>
<li>A Porsche Boxter with a hybrid motor, less luxury, less weight, less&nbsp;cost.  </li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.acpropulsion.com/tzero_pages/tzero_home.htm">tzero</a> with
a hybrid motor, and better styling, made by a major&nbsp;manufacturer.  </li>
<li>An <span class="caps">MR2</span> with a slightly beefier version of the Prius&nbsp;engine.  </li>
<li>An <span class="caps">RX</span>-8 with a hybrid motor, less weird styling, slightly&nbsp;smaller.</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you buy&nbsp;one?</p>

    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>About a week ago, I started seeing these virus e-mail messages with
subjects like &#8220;Your email Account is suspended for security reasons&#8221; and
&#8220;Notice: **Last Warning**&#8221; coming through an open relay in the
Netherlands. Neither my virus scanner or <span class="caps">SPAM</span> filter recognized them as&nbsp;malicious.</p>
<p>So, in the middle of last week, I submitted a sample to
<a href="http://clamav.net">clamav.net</a> which is the virus scanner that I run,
and at almost the exact same time, the messages began to be marked as
<span class="caps">SPAM</span> because someone had added the source <span class="caps">IP</span> to the <span class="caps">RBL</span>, and the message
bodies to Pyzor, <span class="caps">DCC</span>, etc. They were coming in at about 10-20 per day,
and going into my <span class="caps">SPAM</span>&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>I checked back with
<a href="http://lurker.clamav.net/message/20050522.110718.c953273e.en.html">clamav.net</a>,
and they have classified the virus as Worm.MyTob.<span class="caps">BV</span>.</p>
<p>Today, I got about 125 of these messages. I suspect its on the rise, and
this is the first time that I&#8217;ve seen a fair number of virus messages in
the early stages get through my&nbsp;filters.</p>
<p>In the future, when I see a virus or suspicious message that wasn&#8217;t
classified by the scanners (even if it is caught as <span class="caps">SPAM</span>) I&#8217;m going to
immediately report it at clamav.net, and allow them to share the&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>I fear that MyTob.<span class="caps">BV</span> is going to be a pretty big&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, many of the messages contain a link that says
&#8220;your account has expired, click here to log in&#8221; with a link to the
domain that the e-mail is targeted to (in this case, that would be a
link to my own site at slacy.com). I find this very odd (what is their
gain? Why are they doing this?) but I&#8217;ve noticed almost no increase in
web traffic because of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Note: The first copy of this type of thing I got has been classified as
Worm.MyTob.<span class="caps">BN</span>-2. I recieved this first message on 5/11, and it was
classified on 5/17, so I could have been a great help in the cause.
Since then, its mutated through several versions, and <span class="caps">BN</span> seems to be the
one thats catching&nbsp;on.</p>

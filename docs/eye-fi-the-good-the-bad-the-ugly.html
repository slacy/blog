        <p>So, I&#8217;ve got the <a href="http://eye.fi">Eye-Fi</a> card from work. First, the&nbsp;good:</p>
<ol>
<li>It works. I was actually doubtful that this thing worked at all. I
    can attest that its a real product, and it actually&nbsp;works.</li>
<li>It does connect to lots of different online photo sites, including
    Gallery2 and Picasaweb. Thats&nbsp;nice.</li>
</ol>
<p>And now for the bad <span class="amp">&amp;</span> the&nbsp;ugly:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first card I got was broken, and diagnosing this was
    quite difficult. The replacement card seems to work&nbsp;okay.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t actually understand the use case for this thing &#8212; you need
    to put the card in your laptop to associate it with a new
    wireless network. There&#8217;s no &#8220;use any open wireless network you can
    find&#8221; option. Thats a missing &#8216;killer&#8217; feature, in my&nbsp;opinion</li>
<li>It won&#8217;t connect to the Google Wireless in Mountain View, or any
    other wireless network which requires an <span class="caps">HTML</span> login&nbsp;page.</li>
<li>Its slow. You have to leave the camera on for several minutes after
    taking a picture to wait for them to be uploaded to the&nbsp;web.</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t support movies. If you take a movie on the camera, it
    just sits there, and isn&#8217;t automatically&nbsp;uploaded.</li>
<li>It chews up the camera&#8217;s batteries. Yes, they say its low power, but
    plain flash memory uses literally no memory when the camera is idle.
    The Eye-Fi makes a noticable dent in the <span class="caps">SD550</span>&#8217;s battery&nbsp;life</li>
<li>It gets hot. The area near the card is noticibly warm when using the
    camera now. Thats sorta spooky, considering that Wi-Fi is nearly
    microwave&nbsp;frequency</li>
<li>The &#8220;Eye-Fi Manager&#8221; software is a web application. (why?!) You have
    to log in with userid <span class="amp">&amp;</span> password if you want to change settings on
    the card. This makes absolutely no sense to me. I bought a piece of
    hardware, why does it require a connection to the &#8216;net just to
    configure it? Stoopid! Oh, and by the way, the Eye-Fi manager really
    seems like alpha-quality software&nbsp;anyway.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no visible status indicator for the card. From the camera,
    there&#8217;s no way to see if all your pictures have been uploaded to
    the&nbsp;web.</li>
<li>It only comes in <span class="caps">SD</span> formfactor, not in CompactFlash. I&#8217;ve seen
    adapters, but they seem to be made out of metal, so I can imagine
    that they&#8217;d work very&nbsp;well</li>
</ol>
<p>How this thing should&nbsp;work:</p>
<p>Since there&#8217;s clearly a reasonable <span class="caps">CPU</span> on the card, it should be doing
something a lot smarter. One option is to put a bunch of &#8216;virtual&#8217;
pictures on the card that can be looked at and manipulate the settings
of the card. For example, there should be a visible image that says
something&nbsp;like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>34 pictures taken so far, 19 uploaded to the web, 15 remaining.
Currently associated with network &#8220;FooBar&#8221; with a speed of 3Mbps.
Pictures will be posted to&nbsp;Picasa&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that would be rendered in a <span class="caps">JPG</span> file that I could view using the
playback interface of the camera. When it comes to configuration, the
only operation that I could think of that every camera supports is
&#8216;delete&#8217;. So, there could be a bunch of pictures, each of which says
something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Delete this photo to disable Wi-Fi connection for the&nbsp;card</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Delete this photo to associate with open wireless network &#8220;Hacker&#8217;s&nbsp;Paradise&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The embedded <span class="caps">CPU</span> could realize when the photos were deleted, and then
perform the appropriate operation. These 2 things: Turing the WiFi
capability on and off, and associating with any open network, are
absolutely critical to making this a reasonable and useful&nbsp;product.</p>
<p>My end verdict: Don&#8217;t buy the Eye-Fi card. It has such a limited
use-case that its nearly useless. Its great for putting pictures taken
at home on the web, live, and thats about it. Maybe that meets a lot of
people&#8217;s needs, but it seems like its just not that useful for a broad
audience. Its much much faster to just plug the card or camera into a
<span class="caps">USB</span> 2.0 port and copy the pictures that way. Posting to the web
automatically is really nice, but could be written as a software-only
solution for anything connected via <span class="caps">USB</span>.</p>

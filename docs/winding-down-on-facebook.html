    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>I&#8217;ve been winding down my use of Facebook over the last several months,
particularly when it comes to sharing photos and more personal/family
details, but in general I&#8217;m finding that I get less and less utility
from <span class="caps">FB</span> in general.  This has meant that for me, the privacy concerns
now outweigh the benefit of social sharing using <span class="caps">FB</span>&#8217;s&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>There are several things that started this, but the first was a general
feeling of Facebook fatigue, particularly caused by notifications on my
phone.  Additionally, it seemed as though with each app update, they
were requesting more and more intrusive permissions.  The list has
really gotten out of control, including reading <span class="amp">&amp;</span> writing my contacts,
read <span class="amp">&amp;</span> write my phone call log, reading <span class="amp">&amp;</span> sending <span class="caps">SMS</span> messages, view
running applications.  This is a hugely intrusive and unnecessary&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>At the same time, I found that my Facebook feed was mostly full of
advertisements along the lines of &#8221;Bob likes Target&#8221; and &#8220;Jane likes
amazon.com&#8221; type messages.  Completely unnecessary and irrelevant
content.  I found that my &#8220;friends&#8221; (really, friends-of-friends and
beyond) had primarily switched from sharing self-authored content to
posting links to off-site &#8220;funny&#8221; content.  I have many sources of
&#8220;funny&#8221; content, and I don&#8217;t really need another&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>After uninstalling the app, I found that the mobile web version
available on m.facebook.com was fast <span class="amp">&amp;</span> easy to load, and had virtually
none of the privacy concerns of the native application, so I&#8217;ve switched
all my mobile usage to&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>But, in switching away from the native app, I found that sharing photos
from my phone was much harder, and I was inclined to just not do it&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<p>At the same time, Google+ began rolling out some really interesting
improvements to their photo sharing&nbsp;product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-backup and easy download of all my photos from my
    Android&nbsp;device.</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Auto awesome&#8221; photo enhancements, animations, &#8220;stories&#8221;&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>Easy to use fine-grained privacy controls.  I can easily manage <span class="amp">&amp;</span>
    share with a small group and understand the ramifications
    of&nbsp;sharing.</li>
<li>Users can request access to albums they can&#8217;t&nbsp;see.</li>
<li>Its not as ugly as Facebook, particularly the photo stream <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;galleries</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s basically it.  So, if you want to find me and what I&#8217;m up to, I&#8217;m
mostly doing the interesting stuff on Google+ these&nbsp;days.</p>

        <p>Okay, I really hate to write this post, but I&#8217;ve been subscribed to
ev@listproc.sjsu.edu for a while now, and I&#8217;ve gotten almost zero useful
information from it. I&#8217;m tempted to write up something similar for them
to read, but I figure if they search around enough, maybe they&#8217;ll find
this and learn&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>1. I don&#8217;t care about your drag racing. Really. Just stop it. I don&#8217;t
care. Here&#8217;s an editied excerpt from a&nbsp;post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&#8230;] 0-60 in about 4 seconds, it appears [his car&#8217;s] 0-60 is
closer to 3.5 seconds. [&#8230;] and before the 1/8th mile marker (by
then [his car] is clipping along at 86-87 mph) where [another car]
is doing about 60 mph, [&#8230;] lagging behind by 3-4 car lengths when
[his car] is already at 60 mph, [&#8230;] and again, at around where
[his car] is hitting 60 mph, this vehicle is 5 car lengths behind.
[&#8230;] at around 60 mph in [his car] the Viper too, is several car
lengths behind. [&#8230;] 60 mph in about 3 seconds flat, and [his
car] holds its own with these machines up to about 50-55 mph, so
again, the 3.5 second&nbsp;0-60</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give it a fricking break dude! I don&#8217;t care! Just listen to yourself!
Look at how many times you mentioned the name of your car! How many
times do you mention 0-60. I <span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T <span class="caps">CARE</span>!</p>
<p>2. Unbearable long &#8220;I just got back from vacation and here&#8217;s what I did&#8221;
posts. You know the kind. There&#8217;s always that one guy at work who writes
these e-mails that are 5 pages long, going on and on about how wonderful
his trip to Juba-Juba was. Well, on the <span class="caps">EV</span> list, this happens several
times a week, except its not about a vacation, its about some inane and
irrelvant subject, and its boring and&nbsp;useless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time for a [Guy] update. [&#8230;] been up to [Guy&#8217;s] a few times
[&#8230;] Turns out the Construction co <span class="caps">DID</span> have some insurance! [&#8230;]
he had a constant flow of just <span class="caps">PEOPLE</span>, in suits, [&#8230;] City of
Wooster(Worcester)and almost EVERYwhere! [&#8230;] recreation of the
World Trade Center scene. EVen <span class="caps">SMELLS</span> like the <span class="caps">WTC</span>! [&#8230;] neat piles
of metal scrap, dead, melted motorcycles,! [&#8230;] we&#8217;ll dig it out
and roll it over and drop them&nbsp;out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do I care?&nbsp;No.</p>
<p>3. Dissing each other&#8217;s electric cars. There has been a long thread over
the last few days thats saying what a terrible thing the Tesla Roadster
is. How can *any* production <span class="caps">EV</span> be a terrible thing? Most people are
saying that its too expensive, and that no one needs an <span class="caps">EV</span> that fast.
(see drag racing above?). I think its because a lot of the people put in
their blood sweat, tears and many, many dollars into their cars. What
they get is a used hunk-o-junk that barely goes on the highway. Tesla
offers a real sports car, for a little more money, with a lot more&nbsp;performance.</p>
<p>4. No information at all about <span class="caps">AC</span> drivetrains. Everybody has a <span class="caps">DC</span> setup,
and yet every production electric car ever made has had an <span class="caps">AC</span>
drivetrain. Why no info? Whats&nbsp;wrong?</p>
<p>5. Lots and lots of &#8220;inside jokes&#8221;. When I read the list, I feel like
I&#8217;ve stepped into some kind of &#8220;<span class="caps">EV</span> club&#8221; where new members aren&#8217;t
welcomed. Lots of jokes about &#8220;Frank Grimes messed up my motor&#8221; (when
Frank is really a guy who rebuilds motors, apparently) and then first
and second degree derivative inside jokes, which last for 4 or 5 days.
Is this really related to EVs at all?&nbsp;No.</p>
<p>6. Drifting threads and subject lines make it impossible to sort the
&#8220;good&#8221; from the &#8220;crap&#8221;. I would be okay with all this crap, if it
weren&#8217;t interleaved with the seemingly &#8220;good&#8221; messages. The whole list
becomes unbearable if you can&#8217;t just ignore irrelavent&nbsp;threads.</p>

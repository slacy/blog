        <p>I&#8217;m getting tired of the performance problems with my current machine.
Surprisingly enough, I think I&#8217;m getting <span class="caps">CPU</span>-bound on a lot of the
things I do (transcoding <span class="amp">&amp;</span> encoding music, sizing photos, panoramas,
etc.) So I&#8217;m going to start building a new&nbsp;machine.</p>
<p>What I know: Its going to be a full tower <span class="caps">AMD</span> Athlon system, and its
gonna have a lot of drives in it (at least 3x250G, maybe even 6x250G or
6x400G, depending on how I have them set up). I&#8217;m going to run linux
software <span class="caps">RAID</span> 5 managed by <span class="caps">LVM</span>. That way, I can add more space as
necessary, and have the level of redundancy that I&#8217;d like (reliable
storage is very important). Price is not really an issue, as I can
justify that its going to last for at least a couple of years. I&#8217;m
thinking of doing the thing I usually say I won&#8217;t, which is buying the
fastest system I can make. We&#8217;ll see how that conflicts with my acoustic&nbsp;goals.</p>
<p>The one thing that I haven&#8217;t figured out yet is the graphics card &#8212; all
the modern nVidia chipsets have horrendus fans on them (some sites sell
quieter replacements, which I may look into). One of the annoyances with
my current system is that it doesn&#8217;t have accellerated video, and some
simple operations eat up way too much <span class="caps">CPU</span> time, so I want to make sure I
have at least a little accelleration. But, its going to be a Linux
server/desktop machine, and I don&#8217;t plan on running games on it, so 3D
performance isn&#8217;t crucial, but it would be nice every once in a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>The other aspect that I haven&#8217;t decided on is if I want to run 64-bit
Linux (Fedora Core 4) on it or not. I&#8217;m going to do a bunch of research
and see if all the packages are generally available in 64-bit versions.
My other question is: If you&#8217;re running a 64-bit kernel, is there some
sort of &#8220;32-bit compatability layer&#8221; that will let you run apps compiled
for 32-bit? And if so, what is the performance penalty? Those are the
biggest questions so&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>The important part is that I want this beast to be &#8220;Relatively Quiet&#8221; as
I call it. I&#8217;m not planning to build a silent or fanless or watercooled
<span class="caps">PC</span>, I just want something that doesn&#8217;t sound like a jet-powered wind
tunnel. So, I&#8217;m researching my options, and came across a couple good
sites. The ones I like so far&nbsp;are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.endpcnoise.com/">End <span class="caps">PC</span>&nbsp;Noise</a>  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/">Silent <span class="caps">PC</span> Review (the best of the&nbsp;bunch)</a>  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.acoustiproducts.com/en/index.asp">Acousti Products - who make a lot of the stuff the other sites&nbsp;sell</a>  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.quietpcusa.com/">Quiet <span class="caps">PC</span> <span class="caps">USA</span>, a retailer</a><br>
<a href="http://siliconacoustics.com">Silicon Acoustics, a great source of hard drive suspensions and other
quiet&nbsp;accessories</a></p>
<p>Looks like most people are saying that the Antec Sonata is a good case,
one of the new Zalman heat syncs, and the rest is pretty standard, with
maybe a quiet power supply and replacement graphics card cooling fans.
Since the higher clock Athlon&#8217;s aren&#8217;t really rated at a higher wattage,
I&#8217;m probably just going to go with one step down from the fastest chip.
I&#8217;m still trying to figure out <span class="caps">AMD</span>&#8217;s marketing and product lineup, which
is a real mystery at this&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>If you have any recommendations, please comment or drop me a&nbsp;line.</p>

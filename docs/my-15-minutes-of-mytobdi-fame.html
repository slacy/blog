        <p>Just a quick update &#8212; 4 more messages slipped through today, even
though I&#8217;m on the 2-hour update regime. I think the limiting factor here
has become clamav&#8217;s response time, not my update time. On clamav.net,
there are a couple links to german sites talking about the rate at which
different virus scanners responded to the Sober worm. Clamav was in the
top 3 on all the lists, so thats comforting, but the disturbing thing is
that I think they were all averaging between 7 and 8 hours to respond.
Thats unnerving, because I&#8217;m recieving literally hundreds of copies of
these viruses in that sort of timeframe. I wonder what it takes to make
that number faster (on&nbsp;average).</p>
<p>So, I got an unclassified suspicious message at 8:16pm <span class="caps">PDT</span> today. It was
titled &#8220;*<span class="caps">DETECTED</span>* <span class="caps">ONLINE</span> <span class="caps">USER</span> <span class="caps">VIOLATION</span>&#8221; and looks exactly like every
other MyTob variant. I went to clamav.net and used the online submission
engine, which has an always up-to-date copy of the virus signatures. It
didn&#8217;t recognize it, so I submitted it using the online submission&nbsp;form.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I got other versions with different subjects at
8:40pm, 9:38pm, 10:33pm and&nbsp;12:14am.</p>
<p>At 12:05am, I got the message saying that my submission had been
processed, and I checked the <a href="http://lurker.clamav.net/list/clamav-virusdb.html">clamav
updates</a> page, to see
what its status was. It turns out I was the <em>first</em> person to identify
MyTob.<span class="caps">DI</span>. I feel sort of
<a href="http://lurker.clamav.net/message/20050615.070207.7e4987f2.en.html">proud</a>,
and sort of disturbed that the viruses are hitting my machine so early
in the spread cycle. Maybe I&#8217;m underestimating how quickly these are
spreading, and hopefully I&#8217;m not on some &#8220;hot list&#8221; of machines to&nbsp;hit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also grateful to the clamav writers and maintainers for keeping my
system clean, and keeping on top of things so quickly. A total of under
2 hours between when I got the message and when a signature was
available. Good&nbsp;work!</p>

        <p>I saw <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1728755,00.html">this article in Time magazine that quotes a half dozen different
child sleep
&#8216;studies&#8217;</a>
and it made me really upset. Its full of doom-and-gloom quotes about
childrens sleep habits, when in reality, there is usually very little a
parent can do to settle down a truly fussy baby. We&#8217;re not having any
trouble getting Isaac to sleep, thank goodness, but I know friends and
coworkers are having issues with their&nbsp;kids.</p>
<p>I just want to say how damaging I think articles like that one are. Its
quotes like this that really upset&nbsp;me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Babies who grew accustomed to falling asleep with a parent in the
room, being held until they fell asleep, or being taken into a
parent&#8217;s bed when they couldn&#8217;t sleep were also more likely as older
children to have trouble falling asleep and to sleep fewer hours
during the&nbsp;night.</p>
<p>[<span class="caps">ED</span>: And then in the next&nbsp;paragraph]</p>
<p>According to a burgeoning body of research, children who don&#8217;t sleep
enough may be at risk for health problems later in life. Two
additional reports, also appearing in the current issue of Archives of
Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, suggest that children&#8217;s
sleeplessness may be associated with an increased risk of being
overweight and having emotional and behavioral difficulties in
adolescence and&nbsp;adulthood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in other words, if I let my child fall asleep in my arms, then he&#8217;s
going to have behavioral difficulties in adulthood? Uh, yeah,&nbsp;right.</p>

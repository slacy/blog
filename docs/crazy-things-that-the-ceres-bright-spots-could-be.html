        <p>Here&#8217;s a quick list of some crazy things that the Ceres bright dots
could (or could not)&nbsp;be.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Biological Alien&nbsp;City</p>
<p>Unlikely.  Current measurements of reflectivity of the spots says
&#8220;they&#8217;re as reflective as water ice&#8221; or, in other terms &#8220;white
as snow&#8221;.  Now, that&#8217;s not to say that there couldn&#8217;t be a race of
aliens who have constructed a completely white city (complete with
nearby suburbs!) but it seems quite&nbsp;unlikely.</p>
<p>For biological life, there needs to be lots of other things present,
likely water, source of food energy, like other plants and/or
animals, or some kind of &#8220;Food farm&#8221;.  We could be looking at the
top of a &#8221;biodome&#8221; type structure, enclosing a habitation
environment, though.   (As below, likely coated in something like
Titanium Dioxide to reduce heat <span class="amp">&amp;</span> radiation&nbsp;exposure)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Mechanical Alien&nbsp;City</p>
<p>By &#8220;Mechanical Alien&#8221; I mean &#8220;Machine Intelligence&#8221; or more
simply: &#8220;robots from outer space&#8221;.  This seems more likely than
any form of biological alien.  If the spots are created
by aliens, then why would they choose Ceres over all the other
nearby planets?  One simple choice would be the presence of
unique or rare elements in Ceres&#8217; crust or core.  Mechanical
life could be attracted by an abundance of rare elements like
Gallium or Titanium or even Helium (or tons of other&nbsp;options).</p>
<p>We could be looking at a drilling or mining station and outpost,
or even a single large mechanical life-form that&#8217;s working,
stranded or crashed in that location.   Remember that when you
think about mechanical life, all assumptions about size <span class="amp">&amp;</span> scale
can be thrown out the window.  This could be a colony of
trillions of small machines, or one single big one, or something
in&nbsp;between.</p>
<p><p>
This even (somewhat) could explain the &#8220;white as ice&#8221; nature of
the spots.  If you were to make machines capable of interstellar
travel, what color would you make the ships? Probably very, very
white &#8212; this would give you maximum visibility in space, but
also maximum reflectivity (or control thereof) to minimize the
heating from nearby sun(s).  There are several common elements
that would lead to the white nature &#8212; Something like a thin
coating of Titanium Oxide on the surface of a building
or machine.   The interesting point about this is that it also
explains the Infrared readings showing that some of the spots
were not cooler than their surroundings, and I believe that
white titanium dioxide would almost exactly match this behavior,
since it&#8217;s highly reflective to Infrared&nbsp;radiation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some kind of &#8220;Beacon&#8221;
    <p>
    Something left behind by a biological or mechanical intelligence.  
    Also seems unlikely &#8212; if this were truly meant as a beacon of some
    sort, then why just reflective and not&nbsp;emissive?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water or Carbon Dioxide&nbsp;Ice</p>
<p>The weird thing about this is that on a planet with little to no
atmosphere, the common belief is that over several millenia,
anything on the surface gets coated by dust from the impact ejecta
from the constant bombardment of&nbsp;meteors.</p>
<p>So, for there to be surface-exposed ice in such a large volume (many
km across) and for it to not be covered in ice, it either needs to
be a very recent feature (recent impact exposing sub-surface ice) or
an active geological feature.  Because this is at the center of a
crater that doesn&#8217;t appear to be recent, we then assume that this is
an active geological feature, erupting out sub-surface ice in a
somewhat constant&nbsp;manner.</p>
<p><p>
But, science measurements from Dawn&#8217;s onboard Infrared cameras have
shown that this region (Spot 5) is *not* cooler than its
surroundings, so that sort of negates the possibility of some sort
of&nbsp;ice.</p>

        <p>As you may have heard, we&#8217;ve just purchased a grid-tied solar electric
system for our house. When I tell people that we&#8217;re doing this, the
general response is: &#8220;Thats really awesome, but I&#8217;m waiting for advances
in efficency and costs to go down before investing in solar&#8221;. So, here&#8217;s
a list of reasons why I think that the time is <strong>now</strong> to invest in a
solar system and start saving the&nbsp;environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar efficiency has improved very little over the last 20 years. I
    don&#8217;t expect &#8220;leaps and bounds&#8221; increases in efficiency at a
    consumer-friendly price, any time in the next 2 decades. But, I hope
    I&#8217;m proven&nbsp;wrong.</li>
<li>Solar <em>is</em> an investment. It will be cash flow positive, it just
    takes a little while to get there. In the mean time, you save
    the&nbsp;environment.</li>
<li>The price of electricity is going up. Buying solar now means more
    savings in the future, and a shorter payback&nbsp;duration.</li>
<li>The efficiency of a solar system controls nothing more than the
    square footage of panels you need. If future &#8220;high efficiency&#8221;
    systems come to market, they&#8217;ll just be a little smaller than the
    ones being built today. Don&#8217;t be distracted by reports of super-high
    efficiency cells. They&#8217;re usually produced in special laboratories,
    and are well beyond what any homeowner could afford. All that
    matters is dollars per&nbsp;watt!</li>
<li>Investing in solar technology today fuels innovation, drives
    consumer demand, and helps reduce our dependency on gas, diesel <span class="amp">&amp;</span>
    coal fired electricity generation, <em>today.</em></li>
<li>The more solar systems are installed, the higher consumer acceptance
    of such systems will be. By buying a system today, I can raise
    awareness, and inspire future buyers. One big consideration we
    initially had was &#8220;how will our house look with a bunch of
    street-facing panels on the roof.&#8221; Now, my reaction is: I&#8217;m glad all
    our panels are street-facing, because it&#8217;ll show the world that we
    care about our energy consumption, and that we&#8217;re doing something
    about it. The old reaction of &#8220;unsightly solar panels&#8221; needs to
    become a thing of the past, and this will only happen if people see
    solar in their everyday&nbsp;lives.</li>
<li>If, in the next 7 years, if costs of solar systems get cut in half,
    then our break even points will be exactly the same. A solar system
    purchased today takes between 10 and 15 years to pay off. At 50% of
    the cost, it&#8217;ll take 50% of the time to pay off, but that won&#8217;t be
    possible any time soon. Buying now is the same as buying later, if
    all that maters is the time it takes to pay off the&nbsp;system.</li>
<li>15 years isn&#8217;t that long. Time flies, and this is an investment for
    the long term, like buying a new car, except that it&#8217;ll last a <em>lot</em>
    longer than a&nbsp;car.</li>
<li>Solar cells &#8220;wear out&#8221; over time. This is somewhat true, but loss is
    typically about 1% per year, and panels last 30+ years. Individual
    panels cand be replaced and upgraded if they&nbsp;fail.</li>
<li>If you could pay your utility provider a little more for electricity
    <em>today</em>, would you do it? Doesn&#8217;t this mean that the &#8220;value&#8221; of the
    electricity generated by your own solar system is <em>higher</em> than what
    your utility provider pays you for generating it? In other words, if
    you value alternative energy, then you should be willing to pay <span class="amp">&amp;</span>
    invest in&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>The California Solar Initiative rebate program offsets future
    price decreases. The main purpose of the <span class="caps">CSI</span> is to offset possible
    price drops in solar technology <em>today.</em> We&#8217;re getting a rebate of
    \<span class="math">\(2.30/watt, and the average cost of install is about \\)</span>8/watt.
    Thats almost a 30% discount! As systems are installed and the
    rebates &#8220;dry up&#8221; (there&#8217;s a limited supply of rebates available), I
    suspect that the total system cost of solar will go <strong>up</strong> in the
    next year or two, until the panel cost comes down, or the rebate
    program is extended. <span class="caps">CSI</span> is giving away \$2.8 billion in rebates. By
    getting in now, I can get a bigger piece of that&nbsp;pie.</li>
<li>What about off-grid systems? A grid-tied system won&#8217;t power our home
    when there&#8217;s a blackout, because we have no way to store energy. An
    off-grid system has a battery storage system, which adds both cost
    and maintainance. By going with a grid-tied system, I can help the
    environment today, at a price I can afford, and have a zero
    maintainence system. There&#8217;s always the possibility of replacing our
    grid-tied inverter with an off-grid system in the&nbsp;future.</li>

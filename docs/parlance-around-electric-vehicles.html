    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>I was driving on the highway today, and was looking at the other cars,
and parcitularly, their &#8220;badging&#8221;. I saw things like &#8220;5.8&#8221;, &#8220;V8&#8221;,
&#8220;Turbo&#8221;, &#8220;2.0T&#8221;, &#8220;<span class="caps">VR6</span>&#8221; and even an occasional &#8220;Fuel Injection&#8221;, &#8220;<span class="caps">HSD</span>&#8221;,
&#8220;<span class="caps">VTEC</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="caps">VVTI</span>&#8221;. What I realized is that these are all <span class="caps">ICE</span>-specific
terms, and that its part of the giant marketing phenomenon that is the
major auto manufacturers. I also realized a couple&nbsp;things:</p>
<p>First, if your friend got a new car, and you asked what kind of engine,
and he said &#8220;Its got a 2.3&#8221; you&#8217;d actually know what he was talking
about. Similarly, for &#8220;Its got a&nbsp;V8&#8221;.</p>
<p>Second, that there are an immense set of stats and numbers that the
average person understands around <span class="caps">ICE</span> parlance: Displacement in Liters
or Cubic Inches, Horsepower, Number of Cylinders, &#8220;Extras&#8221; like Turbo or
Supercharger, Torque in Foot Pounds, and last of all, Highway and City
Fuel&nbsp;Economy.</p>
<p>I think that <a href="http://teslamotors">Tesla Motors</a> and even Toyota, should
begin to educate the public around the stats that are interesting for
Electric&nbsp;Vehicles.</p>
<p>Here are some things to think&nbsp;about:</p>
<p>Displacement \~= Voltage (say, 144V)<br>
Max Torque \~= Maximum Amperage (say, 1000A, depending on motor)<br>
Fuel Economy = Watt Hours / mile (Wh/m) for city <span class="amp">&amp;</span> highway driving<br>
Gas Tank Size \~= Total battery pack size in Watt Hours (say, 15kWh for
a small&nbsp;car)</p>
<p>The other crazy thing is that the methods of measurement of Horsepower
and Torque for <span class="caps">ICE</span> engines vs. Electric motors is vastly different. You
can&#8217;t just say that a 100hp gas motor is the same power as a 100hp
electric motor. Its generally accepted that the electric motor is rated
at about half of the equivalent number that a gas motor would have. So,
that means thta a 100hp electric motor is as &#8220;fast&#8221; as a 200hp gas&nbsp;motor.</p>
<p>So, some day, your friend will get a new <span class="caps">EV</span>, and you&#8217;ll say &#8220;what kind
of motor does it have?&#8221; and he&#8217;ll say &#8220;Its got a 288V system that can
draw 2000A&#8221; and you&#8217;ll know that he&#8217;ll be smoking tires up to 40&nbsp;mph.</p>

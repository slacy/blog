        <p>Okay, so lets say you&#8217;re doing a download of about (what should be) 18Gb
of music files, and you&#8217;re putting them in /tmp before you copy them
into your music&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>When the download appears to finish, 3 days later, you notice that you
only have 5Gb of files, and that there are huge chunks of files missing.
What&nbsp;happened?</p>
<p>A.) There were <span class="caps">HTTP</span> errors and some files did not respond.<br>
B.) The serving website found out what you were doing, and stopped you.<br>
C.) tmpwatch ran in the middle of the night and deleted huge chunks of
valuable data.<br>
D.) You ran out of disk&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>The answer, my friends, is C. What was happening was that tmpwatch runs
on a nightly basis, and deletes things that it thinks are more than 10
days old. Even these files were just downloaded, wget makes their
modification times match the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers so that it can compare them
later and redownload the ones that have changed. Therefore, the files
that seemed &#8220;new&#8221; to you actually had a modification time of months&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>The man page for tmpwatch says that it tries to look at access time, but
seemingly, writing the file isn&#8217;t considered accessing it, so it deleted
them all. So, the download process took 3 days, but tmpwatch ran twice,
so over 2/3 of the data was deleted. I got just under 6Gb. I&#8217;m
recovering, but slowly. This time I&#8217;m limiting wget&#8217;s download rate so
that it doesn&#8217;t max out my <span class="caps">DSL</span>. It should take another week or so to
complete, I&nbsp;think.</p>
<p>Lesson learned: Always download directly into your music folder, not
into&nbsp;/tmp.  </p>

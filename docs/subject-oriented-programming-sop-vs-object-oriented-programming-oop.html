    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>When I&#8217;m programming, I usually anthroporporphize the code and the
actors involved, and that means when I&#8217;m thinking about program flow, I
think of it as if they&#8217;re real actors doing the tasks needed, and then I
convert that back into code.  But, when reading other people&#8217;s code, I
often times find it hard to convert back into my internal actor-based
representation.  I realized that this is because the term &#8220;Object
Oriented Programming&#8221; should likely be called &#8220;Subject Oriented
Programming&#8221;  I&#8217;m using the term Subject the way you use it when
describing English sentence structure.  Take a look at&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The boy put the box in the&nbsp;bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just to refresh your grade school English (which I had to do as well),
take a brief look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_diagram">sentence diagramming article on
wikipedia</a>. Our sentence
above boils down&nbsp;to:</p>
<p>Subject: &#8220;The boy&#8221;<br>
Predicate <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Direct object: &#8220;put the box&#8221;<br>
Indirect object: &#8220;in the&nbsp;bag&#8221;</p>
<p>How would you represent that in code? Think about it for a second before
continuing. So, here are the possibilities of how this could be written
with a single method&nbsp;call:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>// Subject-Oriented programming:
// &quot;The boy put the box in the bag&quot;
boy.PutIn(box, bag);

// Direct-object oriented programming:
// &quot;The box was put in the bag by the boy&quot;
box.PutIn(bag, boy);

// Indirect-object oriented programming:
// &quot;The bag, to which was added a box, was done by the boy.&quot;  OR
// &quot;A bag now has a box that was put there by the boy.&quot;
bag.AddTo(box, boy);
</pre></div>


<p>So, which is correct via the principles of <span class="caps">OOP</span>? What&#8217;s the correct place
for the method that does the work? Is it on the Subject of the sentence?
The Direct Object? Were you taught how to design this? (i.e. in&nbsp;school?)</p>
<p>In practice, method placement is one of the biggest factors in how
maintainable <span class="amp">&amp;</span> testable your code is, and code is rarely as simple as
what I&#8217;ve shown above. How do you figure out where the right place for
your methods&nbsp;are?</p>
<p>One code base where this was thought about a lot was in Python&#8217;s
handling of string <span class="amp">&amp;</span> list methods. The split() and join() methods in
Python are both on the string type. In other words: The list type is
rigid in that its methods contain no string-manipulation. This seems
good at first until you read the&nbsp;code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>s = &quot;Hello, world&quot;
# Split the string into a list of &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;world&quot;:
l = s.split(&#39;,&#39;)
# Now, take that resulting list, and join it back together:
j = &#39;,&#39;.join(l)
</pre></div>


<p>Wow, that last line looks weird! What&#8217;s going on there? We&#8217;re creating a
temporary string &#8220;,&#8221; and then calling the join() method! Weird! For that
last line, I would have much preferred to&nbsp;write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>j = l.join(&#39;,&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>To be symmetric with the original splitting code, but to write things
that way would place a string generating method &#8220;join()&#8221; on the list
class, which also seems&nbsp;wrong.</p>

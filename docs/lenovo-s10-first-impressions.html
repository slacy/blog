    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Okay, I&#8217;ve had my Lenovo S10 since Friday.  I briefly played around with
the default Windows <span class="caps">XP</span> install, upgraded the <span class="caps">BIOS</span>, and then installed
Ubuntu 8.10 as my primary disk, and wiped the <span class="caps">OKR</span> (One Key Recovery)
partition, since I don&#8217;t really want to ever restore&nbsp;Windows.</p>
<p>Here are my first&nbsp;thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The screen is actually more functional than I thought it was going
    to be.  1024x600 is just fine for pretty much everything.  There&#8217;s a
    little more scrolling than normal, but nothing huge.  I do find that
    I am running Firefox in fullscreen mode more, so maybe that makes up
    for&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>The keyboard is actually quite good.  There are only a few weird
    things.  The number keys are offset to the left a bit more than I&#8217;m
    used to, and that means I hit 2 instead of 1, for example.  There
    are some other keyboard quirks, like the \~ key and PgUp/PgDn
    buttons, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be able to get used to those.  The key
    autoreapeat happens a bit faster than I&#8217;m used to, and doesn&#8217;t seem
    to be adjustable in Ubuntu.  (Although repeat on/off does work). 
    I&#8217;m just tapping faster than normal.  The keyboard is large enough
    that I can touch type at full speed with nearly no problems at all. &nbsp;Excellent!</li>
<li>The synaptics track pad works, but the vertical motion is way too
    fast, and I&#8217;m tracking an xorg bug and discussion on mailing lists
    about the patches that are proposed to fix it.  As soon as I can get
    a build of the .deb for people to check out, I&#8217;ll do&nbsp;so.</li>
<li>Battery life.  I only have the &#8220;3-cell&#8221; version, and people complain
    a bit about the battery life.  It seems to be working for 2.5-3
    hours for me, which is really just great for what I&#8217;m using the
    laptop&nbsp;for.</li>
<li>The <span class="caps">CPU</span> is plenty fast, the graphics are plenty fast, and <span class="caps">1GB</span> seems
    like plenty of <span class="caps">RAM</span>.  It really doesn&#8217;t feel like it needs an
    upgrade.  I&#8217;ve even been doing some ./configuge &amp;&amp; ./make stuff for
    the drivers, and it works speedily and well.   The Atom shows up as
    Dual Core, due to hyperthreading.  <span class="caps">CPU</span> Frequency scaling works, and
    the steps are 800Mhz, 1.07GHz, 1.33GHz, and&nbsp;1.6GHz.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s very light, and seems very well built.  The <span class="caps">LED</span> backlit display
    is very bright (on full brightness, which I don&#8217;t really use
    at&nbsp;night).</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a couple of weird quirks, that I&#8217;ve mentioned above but will
reiterate&nbsp;here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Touchpad vertical movement is too fast.  I&#8217;m getting used to it, but
    it would be nice for it to be&nbsp;&#8220;normal&#8221;.</li>
<li>Screen brightness is very dim after a resume from suspend.  (Dimmer
    than anything I can set with the brightness buttons, and it returns
    to normal when I adjust brightness&nbsp;manually)</li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t tested video (webcam) or microphone yet, but sound
    works&nbsp;great.</li>
<li>Keyboard quirks (\~, PgUp, Home, F12, are all hard to press.  There
    are buttons unused by Ubuntu (The &#8216;Home&#8217; button and Windows
    Menu&nbsp;Button)</li>
<li>I&#8217;m having a bunch of trouble with 3-button (middle mouse button)
    emulation in X11.  Supposedly the synaptics driver does it
    automatically, but I haven&#8217;t delved into this much.  It does work,
    but just not predictably.  I&#8217;d like to just set some key+click combo
    to middle&nbsp;mouse.</li>
<li>Keyboard key repeat rate is too fast and delay is too short,
    settings under Ubuntu don&#8217;t seem to take effect. (this is minor, and
    I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get used to&nbsp;it)</li>
</ol>

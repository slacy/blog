        <p>So, I took my car in for service 2 weeks ago because the driver&#8217;s side
window had fallen off its tracks for the second time (the passenger side
has fallen off twice as well), and while I was there, I had them to a
60k service. Let&#8217;s just say it was expensive. They mentioned that I
needed a new battery &#8212; I procrastinated for a week or so, and then one
day while driving home from work my radio cut out, and the <span class="caps">ABS</span>, Airbag,
and Battery lights came on. Ok, time to get a new battery! So, I went
out last weekend and did that, but the battery light still didn&#8217;t go
out. I drove for a couple days thinking that maybe the new battery was a
little low and needed to be charged up (by driving). Then, this morning,
I decided to see what was up, and measured the unloaded battery voltage.
12V! For those who don&#8217;t know &#8212; thats very low. I started the car and
measured the voltage: 11.5V! For car batteries, that means &#8220;totally dead
and not being charged by the car&#8221;. So, I drove to the repair shop, and
they took the car and called with a quote for the repairs. &#8220;The parts
are cheap but it&#8217;ll take us 3 hours of labor&#8221;.&nbsp;Ugh!</p>
<p>In the last month, I&#8217;ve spent 25% of the <a href="http://kbb.com">Kelly Blue
Book</a> value of the car on repairs. And thus, its new
name: Money pit on&nbsp;wheels.</p>

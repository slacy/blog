        <p>We recently took a cross-country trip on Virgin America. The flights
were on-time, the crew was nice, the purple lights were trendy and fun,
and the food was great. But, there were a lot of aspects that I was
extremely disappointed&nbsp;with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Legroom. I&#8217;m 6&#8216;4&#8221;, and there wasn&#8217;t enough legroom. I mean, I was
    totally crushed by the seat in front of me and had no where to go,
    even if fully reclined. I don&#8217;t really think that 6&#8216;4&#8221; is <em>that</em> far
    above the mean for American males, is it? I haven&#8217;t been on a plane
    with that little space <em>ever.</em> Even the &#8220;less legroom&#8221; section of
    JetBlue is more comfortable than Virgin&nbsp;America.</li>
<li>Shoulder room entering the plane. There&#8217;s a plexiglass barrier thats
    not as wide as my shoulders are. I had to squeeze through, carrying
    a backpack and baby in a carseat. Why is this plastic barrier in my
    way?! Let me enter the plane in&nbsp;peace!</li>
<li>Arm rests go up, but not all the way. What is the point of an
    armrest that goes up, if it doesn&#8217;t get out of your way? It would
    only tilt up to about a 45 degree angle, and thats it. This was
    absolutely no help when getting settled in our seats with 3 carry-on
    bags, a baby, a carseat, 2 winter jackets, and a&nbsp;boppy.</li>
<li><span class="caps">VA</span> Red&#8217;s <span class="caps">TV</span> quality. Even the slightest amount of turbulence, or the
    plane turning, would make the video get all pixelated and break up.
    It would then take 5+ minutes for the signal to return to normal.
    All the while, a DishNetwork dialog box would be onscreen saying
    things like &#8220;Now downloading program guide information&#8221;. Well, screw
    the program guide, since I can&#8217;t even browse it at&nbsp;all</li>
<li><span class="caps">VA</span> Red&#8217;s Audio quality. You would think that on a plane thats less
    than 4 months old (<span class="caps">VA</span>&#8217;s first flight was on 8/8/07), that they
    wouldn&#8217;t have broken 1/8&#8221; audio jacks on every single seat. Its
    become the norm for airlines to have broken audio jacks, but I was
    really surprised at this one. Then, when you do actually get the
    audio so that you can hear it, it sounds like crap. Actually, what
    it sounds like is a mono mp3 encoding at about 32kbps. In other
    words, crap. (Why did they bother with such poor encoding and such a
    nice media&nbsp;system?)</li>
<li><span class="caps">VA</span> Red&#8217;s channel selection. There were several channels that never
    displayed anything other than a DishNetwork dialog box saying
    &#8220;You&#8217;re eligible for a free upgrade. Press Enter now.&#8221; Um, do I&nbsp;care?</li>
<li><span class="caps">VA</span> Red&#8217;s <span class="caps">UI</span> in general. Looks like Linux, unfortunately. Unpolished,
    and way too rough around the&nbsp;edges.</li>
<li><span class="caps">VA</span> Red&#8217;s mapping interface. Why doesn&#8217;t the image of the plane
    update in realtime? Seems like the plane moves half way across the
    screen every 5 minutes or so. The inclusion of Google Maps images
    was great, but the lack of updates was&nbsp;horrible.</li>
<li><span class="caps">VA</span> Red&#8217;s suggestions/feedback system was broken. I got all the way
    to typing in a bunch of comments, only to have the &#8216;submit&#8217; button
    fail to work.&nbsp;Ugh.</li>
<li>\<span class="math">\(8 for a movie! And we have to pay twice if we both want to watch
    it? Seriously, this is going a bit far. \\)</span>16 for 2 people to watch a
    movie with crappy audio on an 8&#8221; screen is just too&nbsp;much!</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This feature is unimplemented.&#8221; Then why do you have the menu item
    for it? <span class="caps">GRRRR</span>! Don&#8217;t tempt me with reading e-mail and browsing the
    web when its just a pipe&nbsp;dream!</li>
</ol>
<p>So, a huge thumbs down to <span class="caps">VA</span> Red, and a huge thumbs down to legroom, so
a huge thumbs down to Virgin&nbsp;America.</p>
<p>Sorry guys, you&#8217;re no where even close to being as good as&nbsp;JetBlue.</p>

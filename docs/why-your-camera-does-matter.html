    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>When I was searching around for info about buying a new camera, I came
across <a href="http://kenrockwell.com">Ken Rockwell</a>&#8216;s website, that has a lot
of useful looking articles about photography.  I read a few of them and
took them with a grain of salt, and the whole thing basically slipped my&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>At work today, a photography mailing list mentioned his website as a
reference for camera reviews, and now that I have my camera, I took a
second look at the site, and particularly the article that I had
previously read titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/notcamera.htm">Why Your Camera Does Not
Matter</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m in an interesting place to comment on the article, because I
just switched from a compact (Canon <span class="caps">SD550</span>) to an entry level <span class="caps">DSLR</span> (Canon
Rebel XTi) with a nice lens (Canon 50mm f1.8).  I shoot the same people,
in the same places, in the same conditions, and in the same way. 
Essentially, I&#8217;m using the <span class="caps">DSLR</span> for &#8220;snapshots&#8221;.  So, the only
difference between what I do now and what I did before is the camera. 
You know what?  The difference between the compact digicam and the <span class="caps">DSLR</span>
is absolutely huge. Here&#8217;s the&nbsp;rundown:</p>
<ol>
<li>Low light performance.  The <span class="caps">SD550</span> just doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;fast&#8221; enough
    lens to capture low light situations.  Indoor nighttime shots with
    the <span class="caps">SD550</span> required either a very steady hand (and even that didn&#8217;t
    quite work) or using the flash, which produces that awful &#8220;snapshot&#8221;
    look.   Even without the big lens, the XTi at <span class="caps">ISO1600</span> has about the
    same amount of noise as the <span class="caps">SD550</span> at <span class="caps">ISO400</span>.  Thats 4 times as much
    light with equivalent noise&nbsp;levels.</li>
<li>Contrast and exposure.  The <span class="caps">SD550</span> was continually under or over
    exposing critical areas.  The XTi has much more accurate metering,
    and thus, it does a much better job at making shots look subtle and
    well&nbsp;exposed.</li>
<li>Shutter lag.  This is the most intangible, yet easiest to &#8220;feel&#8221;
    difference between the two.  The XTi is instant, and the <span class="caps">SD550</span> takes
    a half second or so. How that difference impacts the photos is even
    more amazing.  Try capturing a newborn&#8217;s first smile with a compact
    digicam that has nearly a second of lag.  The <span class="caps">DSLR</span> is a huge winner
    here.  The photos I have just wouldn&#8217;t be possible with the
    <span class="caps">SD550</span>,&nbsp;unfortunately.</li>
<li>Speed of shooting.  The XTi&#8217;s continuous shooting mode is easily 2
    or 3 times faster than the <span class="caps">SD550</span>&#8217;s same mode.  This means better
    shots of things that didn&#8217;t last that long.  Again, absolutely
    necessary for good photos of&nbsp;kids.</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Purple fringe&#8221;.  The nice lens of the XTi has none.  The <span class="caps">SD550</span>
    shows purple fringe for most high contrast outdoor shots. This
    always annoyed me about the <span class="caps">SD550</span>, and I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t have to deal
    with it&nbsp;anymore.</li>
<li>Photo aspect ratio.  The XTi takes &#8220;35mm size&#8221; photos that really
    look more like &#8220;photograhs&#8221; than the 4:3 aspect ratio shots from the
    <span class="caps">SD550</span>.  The drawback of the XTi is that the 4:3 aspect is actually
    useful for desktop images, and things like&nbsp;that.</li>
<li>Battery life.  Maybe its because the XTi is new, but the battery
    seems to last much longer than the <span class="caps">SD550</span>.  I also think its because
    the XTi uses the rear <span class="caps">LCD</span>&nbsp;less.</li>
<li>Closeups and zoom.  The 50mm fixed focal distance lens on the XTi
    can take great &#8220;close up&#8221; shots from across the room or just across
    a table.  I find that it makes the shots a lot more personal than
    &#8220;full body&#8221; pictures.  With the <span class="caps">SD550</span>, you really lose a lot of
    light when you zoom in, making low light colse ups even&nbsp;harder.</li>
<li>Removable lenses.  Of course, with any <span class="caps">DSLR</span>, you can replace the
    lenses.  If I find my 50mm to constraining, I can always switch back
    to the default 18-55mm lens and use that.  Or, if I want something
    extra wide, or something extra long, I can choose to purchase those
    lenses.  (This is really a minor point, and I don&#8217;t expect to buy
    any more lenses for the&nbsp;XTi)</li>
</ol>
<p>And here&#8217;s where the <span class="caps">SD550</span> has a slight advantage for my shooting&nbsp;style:</p>
<ol>
<li>Composing shots using the rear <span class="caps">LCD</span> is actually easier than the XTi&#8217;s
    viewfinder.  I&#8217;m still not used to the <span class="caps">DSLR</span> style viewfinder, so I&#8217;m
    not as good at composing shots well.  The photos always seem to have
    more than what I saw, which is&nbsp;weird.</li>
<li>Review <span class="amp">&amp;</span> playback on the <span class="caps">SD550</span> is better.  Its just easier to use
    than the XTi.  The small form factor is better for passing photos
    around a table and sharing with&nbsp;friends.</li>
<li>Movie mode.  The XTi (as with all DSLRs) has no movie mode.  Movies
    are still really useful, especially for&nbsp;kids.</li>
<li>Size.  The <span class="caps">SD550</span> fits in your pocket, and this can&#8217;t be beat.  (But,
    there&#8217;s no point in carrying around a camera that can&#8217;t capture the
    photos you want.  See above&nbsp;points.)</li>
<li>Zoom.  I&#8217;m using a small fixed focal length lens on the XTi.  Its
    somewhat limiting, especially when you want to take group shots. 
    Its sometimes hard to fit more than 2 or 3 people in one photo,
    especially indoors where its difficult to get far enough&nbsp;away. </li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Take my photo please&#8221; is better on the <span class="caps">SD550</span>.  People are afraid of
    <span class="caps">DSLR</span>&#8217;s and generally won&#8217;t take a good photo of you.  The compact
    camera with the <span class="caps">LCD</span> on the back is much better for getting someone
    else to take your&nbsp;picture.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m tempted to use the two cameras and take some comparative shots
similar to Ken&#8217;s website, and post a similar &#8220;why Your Camera Does
Matter&#8221; page.  (maybe someone has already done&nbsp;this?)</p>
